I did it, but I don't know if it's the best way.

I am a beginner and I am learning Python. I have a problem with the Python code below. I am trying to create a program that will take a user input (number) and output the number of times the number is divisible by 2. I am trying to use a while loop and a counter to do this. I am not sure how to make the while loop work. I am also not sure how to make the counter work. Please help.

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
counter = 0

while number > 1:
    number = number / 2
    counter = counter + 1

print("The number is divisible by 2", counter, "times.")
