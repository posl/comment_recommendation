I'm proud of this one. I had to think for a while to figure out how to do it, but the solution was pretty straightforward. I'm not sure if it's the most efficient solution, but it's probably close.

This is a very interesting problem. It's actually the first problem that I've solved that I didn't know how to solve before I started working on it. It's also the first problem that I've solved that I didn't know how to solve after I finished working on it. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I guess it's a good thing that I learned something new, but it's a bad thing that I didn't know how to solve it.

I'm not sure what to write about this problem. I think it's a fun problem, but it's not very interesting to write about. It's not a very complicated problem, and I don't think I learned anything new while solving it. I think it's a good problem to solve if you want to practice your programming skills, but it's not a good problem to write about. I'm not sure what else to say about it.
