Problem Statement
Takahashi has a water bottle with the shape of a rectangular prism whose base is a square of side a[cm] and whose height is b[cm]. (The thickness of the bottle can be ignored.)
We will pour x[cm]^3 of water into the bottle, and gradually tilt the bottle around one of the sides of the base.
When will the water be spilled? More formally, find the maximum angle in which we can tilt the bottle without spilling any water.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ a ≦ 100
1 ≦ b ≦ 100
1 ≦ x ≦ a^2b

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b x

Output
Print the maximum angle in which we can tilt the bottle without spilling any water, in degrees.
Your output will be judged as correct when the absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-6}.

Sample Input 1
2 2 4

Sample Output 1
45.0000000000
This bottle has a cubic shape, and it is half-full. The water gets spilled when we tilt the bottle more than 45 degrees.

Sample Input 2
12 21 10

Sample Output 2
89.7834636934
This bottle is almost empty. When the water gets spilled, the bottle is nearly horizontal.

Sample Input 3
3 1 8

Sample Output 3
4.2363947991
This bottle is almost full. When the water gets spilled, the bottle is still nearly vertical.
