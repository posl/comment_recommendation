Problem Statement
Three poles stand evenly spaced along a line. Their heights are a, b and c meters, from left to right.
We will call the arrangement of the poles beautiful if the tops of the poles lie on the same line, that is, b-a = c-b.
Determine whether the arrangement of the poles is beautiful.

Constraints
1 ≦ a,b,c ≦ 100
a, b and c are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b c

Output
Print YES if the arrangement of the poles is beautiful; print NO otherwise.

Sample Input 1
2 4 6

Sample Output 1
YES
Since 4-2 = 6-4, this arrangement of poles is beautiful.

Sample Input 2
2 5 6

Sample Output 2
NO
Since 5-2 neq 6-5, this arrangement of poles is not beautiful.

Sample Input 3
3 2 1

Sample Output 3
YES
Since 1-2 = 2-3, this arrangement of poles is beautiful.
