Problem Statement
Solve the following problem for T test cases.
Given are non-negative integers a and s. Is there a pair of non-negative integers (x,y) that satisfies both of the conditions below?
x AND y=a
x+y=s

        What is bitwise AND?
    
        The bitwise AND of integers A and B, A AND B, is defined as follows:
        
When A AND B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k ≧ 0) is 1 if those of A and B are both 1, and 0 otherwise.
        For example, we have 4 AND 6 = 4 (in base two: 100 AND 110 = 100).


Constraints
1 ≦ T ≦ 10^5
0 ≦ a,s < 2^{60}
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input. The first line is in the following format:
T
Then, T test cases follow. Each test case is in the following format:
a s

Output
Print T lines. The i-th line (1 ≦ i ≦ T) should contain Yes if, in the i-th test case, there is a pair of non-negative integers (x,y) that satisfies both of the conditions in the Problem Statement, and No otherwise.

Sample Output 1
Yes
No
In the first test case, some pairs such as (x,y)=(3,5) satisfy the conditions.
In the second test case, no pair of non-negative integers satisfies the conditions.
