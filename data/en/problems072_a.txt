Problem Statement
We have a sandglass that runs for X seconds. The sand drops from the upper bulb at a rate of 1 gram per second. That is, the upper bulb initially contains X grams of sand.
How many grams of sand will the upper bulb contains after t seconds?

Constraints
1≤X≤10^9
1≤t≤10^9
X and t are integers.

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X t

Output
Print the number of sand in the upper bulb after t second.

Sample Input 1
100 17

Sample Output 1
83
17 out of the initial 100 grams of sand will be consumed, resulting in 83 grams.

Sample Input 2
48 58

Sample Output 2
0
All 48 grams of sand will be gone, resulting in 0 grams.

Sample Input 3
1000000000 1000000000
