Problem Statement
You are given three strings S_1, S_2, S_3 consisting of lowercase English letters, and a string T consisting of 1, 2, 3.
Concatenate the three strings according to the characters in T and print the resulting string. Formally, conform to the following instructions.
For each integer i such that 1 ≦ i ≦ |T|, let the string s_i be defined as follows:
S_1, if the i-th character of T is 1;
S_2, if the i-th character of T is 2;
S_3, if the i-th character of T is 3.
Concatenate the strings s_1, s_2, dots, s_{|T|} in this order and print the resulting string.

Constraints
