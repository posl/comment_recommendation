Constraints
-2^{63} â‰¦ N < 2^{63}
N is an integer.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
If N is between -2^{31} and 2^{31}-1 (inclusive), print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
10

Sample Output 1
Yes
10 is between -2^{31} and 2^{31}-1, so Yes should be printed.

Sample Input 2
-9876543210

Sample Output 2
No
-9876543210 is less than -2^{31}, so No should be printed.

Sample Input 3
483597848400000
