Problem Statement
Given is a digit sequence S consisting of the digits from 1 through 9.
Takahashi, the bee, loves multiples of 8.
He is trying to make a multiple of 8 by permuting the digit sequence S.
Determine whether it is possible.

Constraints
1 ≦ |S| ≦ 2 times 10^5
Each character of S is one of the digits from 1 through 9.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output
If it is possible to make a multiple of 8 by permuting the digit sequence S, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
1234

Sample Output 1
Yes
For example, permuting 1234 into 1432 results in a multiple of 8.

Sample Input 2
1333

Sample Output 2
No
There is no way to permute 1333 into a multiple of 8.

Sample Input 3
8

Sample Output 3
Yes
