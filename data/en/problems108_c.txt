Problem Statement
You are given integers N and K. Find the number of triples (a,b,c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b,b+c and c+a are all multiples of K.
The order of a,b,c does matter, and some of them can be the same.

Constraints
1 ≦ N,K ≦ 2times 10^5
N and K are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K

Output
Print the number of triples (a,b,c) of positive integers not greater than N such that a+b,b+c and c+a are all multiples of K.
