Problem Statement
In AtCoder City, there are three stations numbered 1, 2, and 3.
Each of these stations is operated by one of the two railway companies, A and B. A string S of length 3 represents which company operates each station. If S_i is A, Company A operates Station i; if S_i is B, Company B operates Station i.
To improve the transportation condition, for each pair of a station operated by Company A and one operated by Company B, there will be a bus service connecting them.
Determine if there is a pair of stations that will be connected by a bus service.

Constraints
Each character of S is A or B.
|S| = 3

Sample Input 1
ABA

Sample Output 1
Yes
Company A operates Station 1 and 3, while Company B operates Station 2.
There will be a bus service between Station 1 and 2, and between Station 2 and 3, so print Yes.
