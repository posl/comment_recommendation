Problem Statement
There are N weights called Weight 1, Weight 2, ..., Weight N.  Weight i has a mass of A_i.
Let us say a positive integer n is a good integer if the following condition is satisfied:
We can choose at most 3 different weights so that they have a total mass of n.
How many positive integers less than or equal to W are good integers?

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 300
1 ≦ W ≦ 10^6
1 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^6
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N W
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
2 10
1 3

Sample Output 1
3
If we choose only Weight 1, it has a total mass of 1, so 1 is a good integer.
If we choose only Weight 2, it has a total mass of 3, so 3 is a good integer.
If we choose Weights 1 and 2, they have a total mass of 4, so 4 is a good integer.
No other integer is a good integer.  Also, all of 1, 3, and 4 are integers less than or equal to W.  Therefore, the answer is 3.

Sample Input 2
2 1
2 3

Sample Output 2
0
There are no good integers less than or equal to W.

Sample Input 3
4 12
3 3 3 3

Sample Output 3
3
There are 3 good integers: 3, 6, and 9.
For example, if we choose Weights 1, 2, and 3, they have a total mass of 9, so 9 is a good integer.
Note that 12 is not a good integer.

Sample Input 4
7 251
202 20 5 1 4 2 100

Sample Output 4
48
