Problem Statement
You are given an integer X. The following action on this integer is called an operation.
Choose and do one of the following.
Add 1 to X.
Subtract 1 from X.

The terms in the arithmetic progression S with N terms whose initial term is A and whose common difference is D are called good numbers.
Consider performing zero or more operations to make X a good number. Find the minimum number of operations required to do so.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
-10^{18} le X,A le 10^{18}
-10^6 le D le 10^6
1 le N le 10^{12}

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X A D N

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
6 2 3 3

Sample Output 1
1
Since A=2,D=3,N=3, we have S=(2,5,8).
You can subtract 1 from X once to make X=6 a good number.
It is impossible to make X good in zero operations.

Sample Input 2
0 0 0 1

Sample Output 2
0
We might have D=0. Additionally, no operation might be required.

Sample Input 3
998244353 -10 -20 30

Sample Output 3
998244363

Sample Input 4
-555555555555555555 -1000000000000000000 1000000 1000000000000

Sample Output 4
