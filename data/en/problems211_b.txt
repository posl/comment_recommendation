Problem Statement
You are given four strings S_1, S_2, S_3, and S_4.
Determine whether this sequence of strings has one of each of the following: H, 2B, 3B, and HR.
Here, it is guaranteed that every S_i is H, 2B, 3B, or HR.

Constraints
Each S_i is H, 2B, 3B, or HR.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S_1
S_2
S_3
S_4

Output
If the given sequence of strings has one of each of H, 2B, 3B, and HR, print Yes.
Otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
