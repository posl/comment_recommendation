Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^4
1 ≦ A ≦ B ≦ 36
All input values are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N A B

Output
Print the sum of the integers between 1 and N (inclusive), whose sum of digits written in base 10 is between A and B (inclusive).

Sample Input 1
20 2 5

Sample Output 1
84
Among the integers not greater than 20, the ones whose sums of digits are between 2 and 5, are: 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20. We should print the sum of these, 84.

Sample Input 2
10 1 2
