Problem Statement
You are given integers A and B, each between 1 and 3 (inclusive).
Determine if there is an integer C between 1 and 3 (inclusive) such that A × B × C is an odd number.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ A, B ≦ 3

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output
If there is an integer C between 1 and 3 that satisfies the condition, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
3 1

Sample Output 1
Yes
Let C = 3. Then, A × B × C = 3 × 1 × 3 = 9, which is an odd number.

Sample Input 2
1 2

Sample Output 2
No

Sample Input 3
2 2

Sample Output 3
No
