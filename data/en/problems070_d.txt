Problem Statement
You are given a tree with N vertices.
Here, a tree is a kind of graph, and more specifically, a connected undirected graph with N-1 edges, where N is the number of its vertices.
The i-th edge (1≤i≤N-1) connects Vertices a_i and b_i, and has a length of c_i.
You are also given Q queries and an integer K. In the j-th query (1≤j≤Q):
find the length of the shortest path from Vertex x_j and Vertex y_j via Vertex K.
