Problem Statement
We have a string S consisting of uppercase English letters. Additionally, an integer N will be given.
Shift each character of S by N in alphabetical order (see below), and print the resulting string.
We assume that A follows Z. For example, shifting A by 2 results in C (A to B to C), and shifting Y by 3 results in B (Y to Z to A to B).
