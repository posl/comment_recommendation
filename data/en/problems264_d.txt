Problem Statement
You are given a string S that is a permutation of atcoder.
On this string S, you will perform the following operation 0 or more times:
Choose two adjacent characters of S and swap them.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make S equal atcoder.

Constraints
S is a string that is a permutation of atcoder

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
catredo

Sample Output 1
8
You can make S equal atcoder in 8 operations as follows:
catredo rightarrow [ac]tredo rightarrow actre[od] rightarrow actr[oe]d rightarrow actro[de] rightarrow act[or]de rightarrow acto[dr]e rightarrow a[tc]odre rightarrow atcod[er]
This is the minimum number of operations achievable.

Sample Input 2
atcoder

Sample Output 2
0
In this case, the string S is already atcoder.

Sample Input 3
redocta

Sample Output 3
21
