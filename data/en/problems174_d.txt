Problem Statement
An altar enshrines N stones arranged in a row from left to right. The color of the i-th stone from the left (1 ≦ i ≦ N) is given to you as a character c_i; R stands for red and W stands for white.
You can do the following two kinds of operations any number of times in any order:
Choose two stones (not necessarily adjacent) and swap them.
Choose one stone and change its color (from red to white and vice versa).
According to a fortune-teller, a white stone placed to the immediate left of a red stone will bring a disaster. At least how many operations are needed to reach a situation without such a white stone?

Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 200000
c_i is R or W.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
c_{1}c_{2}...c_{N}

Output
Print an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed.

Sample Input 1
4
WWRR

Sample Output 1
2
For example, the two operations below will achieve the objective.
Swap the 1-st and 3-rd stones from the left, resulting in RWWR.
Change the color of the 4-th stone from the left, resulting in RWWW.

Sample Input 2
2
RR

Sample Output 2
0
It can be the case that no operation is needed.

Sample Input 3
8
WRWWRWRR

Sample Output 3
