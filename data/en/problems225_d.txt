Problem Statement
Takahashi is playing with toy trains, connecting and disconnecting them.
There are N toy train cars, with car numbers: Car 1, Car 2, ldots, Car N.
Initially, all cars are separated.
You will be given Q queries. Process them in the order they are given.
There are three kinds of queries, as follows.
1 x y: Connect the front of Car y to the rear of Car x.
It is guaranteed that:
x neq y
just before this query, no train is connected to the rear of Car x;
just before this query, no train is connected to the front of Car y;
just before this query, Car x and Car y belong to different connected components.

2 x y: Disconnect the front of Car y from the rear of Car x.
It is guaranteed that:
x neq y;
just before this query, the front of Car y is directly connected to the rear of Car x.  

3 x: Print the car numbers of the cars belonging to the connected component containing Car x, from front to back. 


Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ Q ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ x ≦ N
1 ≦ y ≦ N
All values in input are integers.
All queries satisfy the conditions in the Problem Statement
.
The queries of the format 3 x ask to print at most 10^6 car numbers in total.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
mathrm{query}_1
mathrm{query}_2
vdots
mathrm{query}_Q
The i-th query mathrm{query}_i begins with an integer c_i (1, 2, or 3) representing the kind of the query, followed by x and y if c_i = 1 or 2, and followed by x if c_i = 3.
In short, each query is in one of the following three formats:
1 x y
2 x y
3 x

Output
If a query with c_i = 3 asks to print the values j_1, j_2, ldots, j_M, output the following line:
M j_1 j_2 ldots j_M
Your output should consist of q lines, where q is the number of queries with c_i = 3.
The k-th line (1 ≦ k ≦ q) should contain the response to the k-th such query.

The figure below shows the cars when the first 5 queries are processed.
For example, Car 2 belongs to the same connected component as Cars 3, 5, 6, 7, which is different from the connected component containing Cars 1, 4.
The figure below shows the cars when the first 11 queries are processed.
