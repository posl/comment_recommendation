Problem Statement
You will be given an integer a and a string s consisting of lowercase English letters as input.
Write a program that prints s if a is not less than 3200 and prints red if a is less than 3200.

Constraints
2800 â‰¦ a < 5000
s is a string of length between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
Each character of s is a lowercase English letter.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a
s

Output
If a is not less than 3200, print s; if a is less than 3200, print red.

Sample Input 1
3200
pink

Sample Output 1
pink
a = 3200 is not less than 3200, so we print s = pink.

Sample Input 2
3199
pink

Sample Output 2
red
a = 3199 is less than 3200, so we print red.

Sample Input 3
4049
red

Sample Output 3
red
a = 4049 is not less than 3200, so we print s = red.
