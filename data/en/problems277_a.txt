Problem Statement
You are given a sequence P that is a permutation of (1,2,…,N), and an integer X.
The i-th term of P has a value of P_i.
Print k such that P_k = X.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ X ≦ N
P is a permutation of (1,2,…,N).
All values in the input are integers.

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X
P_1 P_2 ldots P_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
4 3
2 3 1 4

Sample Output 1
2
We have P = (2,3,1,4), so P_2 = 3. Thus, you should print 2.

Sample Input 2
5 2
3 5 1 4 2

Sample Output 2
5

Sample Input 3
6 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
