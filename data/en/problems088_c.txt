Problem Statement
We have a 3 × 3 grid. A number c_{i, j} is written in the square (i, j), where (i, j) denotes the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
According to Takahashi, there are six integers a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 whose values are fixed, and the number written in the square (i, j) is equal to a_i + b_j.
Determine if he is correct.  

Constraints
c_{i, j}  (1 ≦ i ≦ 3, 1 ≦ j ≦ 3) is an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
c_{1,1} c_{1,2} c_{1,3}
c_{2,1} c_{2,2} c_{2,3}
c_{3,1} c_{3,2} c_{3,3}

Output
If Takahashi's statement is correct, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
1 0 1
2 1 2
1 0 1

Sample Output 1
Yes
Takahashi is correct, since there are possible sets of integers such as: a_1=0,a_2=1,a_3=0,b_1=1,b_2=0,b_3=1.

Sample Input 2
2 2 2
2 1 2
2 2 2

Sample Output 2
No
Takahashi is incorrect in this case.

Sample Input 3
0 8 8
0 8 8
0 8 8

Sample Output 3
Yes

Sample Input 4
1 8 6
2 9 7
0 7 7

Sample Output 4
No
