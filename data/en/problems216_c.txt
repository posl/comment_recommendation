Problem Statement
We have an empty box.
Takahashi can cast the following two spells any number of times in any order.
Spell A: puts one new ball into the box.
Spell B: doubles the number of balls in the box.
Tell us a way to have exactly N balls in the box with at most 120 casts of spells.
It can be proved that there always exists such a way under the Constraints
 given.
There is no way other than spells to alter the number of balls in the box.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^{18}
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print a string S consisting of A and B.
The i-th character of S should represent the spell for the i-th cast.
S must have at most 120 characters.

Sample Input 1
5

Sample Output 1
AABA
This changes the number of balls as follows: 0 -{A}-> 1-{A}-> 2 -{B}->4-{A}-> 5.
There are also other acceptable outputs, such as AAAAA.

Sample Input 2
14

Sample Output 2
BBABBAAAB
This changes the number of balls as follows: 0 -{B}-> 0 -{B}-> 0  -{A}->1 -{B}-> 2 -{B}-> 4  -{A}->5  -{A}->6 -{A}-> 7  -{B}->14.
It is not required to minimize the length of S.
