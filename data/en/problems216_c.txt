Problem Statement
We have an empty box.
Takahashi can cast the following two spells any number of times in any order.
Spell A: puts one new ball into the box.
Spell B: doubles the number of balls in the box.
Tell us a way to have exactly N balls in the box with at most mathbf{120} casts of spells.
It can be proved that there always exists such a way under the Constraints
 given.
There is no way other than spells to alter the number of balls in the box.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^{18}
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print a string S consisting of A and B.
The i-th character of S should represent the spell for the i-th cast.
S must have at most mathbf{120} characters.

Sample Input 1
5

Sample Output 1
AABA
This changes the number of balls as follows: 0 xrightarrow{A} 1xrightarrow{A} 2 xrightarrow{B}4xrightarrow{A} 5.
There are also other acceptable outputs, such as AAAAA.

Sample Input 2
14

Sample Output 2
BBABBAAAB
This changes the number of balls as follows: 0 xrightarrow{B} 0 xrightarrow{B} 0  xrightarrow{A}1 xrightarrow{B} 2 xrightarrow{B} 4  xrightarrow{A}5  xrightarrow{A}6 xrightarrow{A} 7  xrightarrow{B}14.
It is not required to minimize the length of S.
