Problem Statement
Takahashi had N glasses of liquor.
The amount and alcohol percentage of the i-th liquor were V_i milliliters and P_i percent by volume, respectively.
Takahashi gets drunk when his alcohol intake exceeds X milliliters.
Which of the N liquors was he drinking when he gets drunk? If he was not drunk even after drinking all the liquors, print -1 instead.

Constraints

1 ≦ N ≦ 10^3
0 ≦ X ≦ 10^6
1 ≦ V_i ≦ 10^3
0 ≦ P_i ≦ 100

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X
V_1 P_1
vdots
V_N P_N

Output
If Takahashi got drunk when drinking the i-th liquor, print i. If he was not drunk even after drinking all the liquors, print -1 instead.

2 15
200 5
350 3

Sample Output 1
2
The 1-st liquor contains 200times dfrac{5}{100}=10 milliliters of alcohol.
The 2-nd liquor contains 350times dfrac{3}{100}=10.5 milliliters of alcohol.
His alcohol intake exceeds 15 milliliters for the first time when drinking the 2-nd liquor.
