Problem Statement
A fruit store sells apples.
You may perform the following operations as many times as you want in any order:
Buy one apple for X yen (the currency in Japan).
Buy three apples for Y yen.
How much yen do you need to pay to obtain exactly N apples?  

Constraints
1 ≦ X ≦ Y ≦ 100
1 ≦ N ≦ 100
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y N

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
10 25 10

Sample Output 1
85
Buy three apples for 25 yen three times and one apple for 10 yen, and you will obtain exactly 10 apples for a total of 85 yen.
You cannot obtain exactly 10 apples for a lower cost, so the answer is 85 yen.

Sample Input 2
10 40 10

Sample Output 2
100
It is optimal to buy an apple for 10 yen 10 times.

Sample Input 3
100 100 2

Sample Output 3
200
The only way to obtain exactly 2 apples is to buy an apple for 100 yen twice.

Sample Input 4
100 100 100

Sample Output 4
3400
