Problem Statement
In Takahashi Kingdom, there is an archipelago of N islands, called Takahashi Islands.
For convenience, we will call them Island 1, Island 2, ..., Island N.
There are M kinds of regular boat services between these islands.
Each service connects two islands. The i-th service connects Island a_i and Island b_i.
Cat Snuke is on Island 1 now, and wants to go to Island N.
However, it turned out that there is no boat service from Island 1 to Island N, so he wants to know whether it is possible to go to Island N by using two boat services.
Help him.

Constraints
3 ≤ N ≤ 200 000
1 ≤ M ≤ 200 000
1 ≤ a_i < b_i ≤ N
(a_i, b_i) ≠ (1, N)
If i ≠ j, (a_i, b_i) ≠ (a_j, b_j).

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
a_1 b_1
a_2 b_2
:
a_M b_M

Output
If it is possible to go to Island N by using two boat services, print POSSIBLE; otherwise, print IMPOSSIBLE.
