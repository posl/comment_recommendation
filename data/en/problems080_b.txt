Problem Statement
An integer X is called a Harshad number if X is divisible by f(X), where f(X) is the sum of the digits in X when written in base 10.
Given an integer N, determine whether it is a Harshad number.

Constraints
1?N?10^8
N is an integer.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print Yes if N is a Harshad number; print No otherwise.

Sample Input 1
12

Sample Output 1
Yes
f(12)=1+2=3. Since 12 is divisible by 3, 12 is a Harshad number.

Sample Input 2
57

Sample Output 2
No
f(57)=5+7=12. Since 57 is not divisible by 12, 12 is not a Harshad number.

Sample Input 3
148

Sample Output 3
No
