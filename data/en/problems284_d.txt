Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer N. It is known that N can be represented as N=p^2q using two different prime numbers p and q.
Find p and q.
You have T test cases to solve.

Constraints
All values in the input are integers.
1≦ T≦ 10
1≦ N ≦ 9times 10^{18}
N can be represented as N=p^2q using two different prime numbers p and q.

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format, where text{test}_i represents the i-th test case:
T
text{test}_1
text{test}_2
vdots
text{test}_T
Each test case is in the following format:
N

Output
Print T lines.
The i-th (1≦ i ≦ T) line should contain p and q for the i-th test case, separated by a space.
Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proved that the pair of prime numbers p and q such that N=p^2q is unique.

Sample Input 1

2023
63
1059872604593911

Sample Output 1
17 7
3 7
104149 97711
For the first test case, we have N=2023=17^2times 7. Thus, p=17 and q=7.
