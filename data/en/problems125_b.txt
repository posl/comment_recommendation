Problem Statement
There are N gems. The value of the i-th gem is V_i.
You will choose some of these gems, possibly all or none, and get them.
However, you need to pay a cost of C_i to get the i-th gem.
Let X be the sum of the values of the gems obtained, and Y be the sum of the costs paid.
Find the maximum possible value of X-Y.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ N ≦ 20
1 ≦ C_i, V_i ≦ 50

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
V_1 V_2 ... V_N
C_1 C_2 ... C_N

Output
Print the maximum possible value of X-Y.

10 2 5
6 3 4

Sample Output 1
5
If we choose the first and third gems, X = 10 + 5 = 15 and Y = 6 + 4 = 10.
We have X-Y = 5 here, which is the maximum possible value.
