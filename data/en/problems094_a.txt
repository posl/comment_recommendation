Problem Statement
There are a total of A + B cats and dogs.
Among them, A are known to be cats, but the remaining B are not known to be either cats or dogs.
Determine if it is possible that there are exactly X cats among these A + B animals.

Constraints
1 ≦ A ≦ 100
1 ≦ B ≦ 100
1 ≦ X ≦ 200
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B X

Output
If it is possible that there are exactly X cats, print YES; if it is impossible, print NO.

Sample Input 1
3 5 4

Sample Output 1
YES
If there are one cat and four dogs among the B = 5 animals, there are X = 4 cats in total.

Sample Input 2
2 2 6

Sample Output 2
NO
Even if all of the B = 2 animals are cats, there are less than X = 6 cats in total.

Sample Input 3
5 3 2

Sample Output 3
NO
Even if all of the B = 3 animals are dogs, there are more than X = 2 cats in total.
