Problem Statement
We have a string S of length 2N.
You are given Q queries on this string.
In the i-th query, given three integers T_i, A_i, and B_i, do the following:
if T_i = 1: swap the A_i-th and B_i-th characters of S;
if T_i = 2: swap the first N characters and last N characters of S (the values A_i and B_i are not used).
  For example, if S is FLIP, this query makes it IPFL.
Print the string S after processing all Q queries in the order they are given.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2 × 10^5
S is a string of length 2N consisting of uppercase English letters.
1 ≦ Q ≦ 3 × 10^5
T_i is 1 or 2.
If T_i = 1, 1 ≦ A_i < B_i ≦ 2N.
If T_i = 2, A_i = B_i = 0.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Sample Output 1
LPFI
The 1-st query swaps the first N characters and last N characters of S, making it IPFL.
The 2-nd query swaps the 1-st and 4-th characters of S, making it LPFI.
