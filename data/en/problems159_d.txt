Problem Statement
We have N balls. The i-th ball has an integer A_i written on it.
For each k=1, 2, ..., N, solve the following problem and print the answer.  
Find the number of ways to choose two distinct balls (disregarding order) from the N-1 balls other than the k-th ball so that the integers written on them are equal.

Constraints
3 ≦ N ≦ 2 times 10^5
1 ≦ A_i ≦ N
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output
For each k=1,2,...,N, print a line containing the answer.

Consider the case k=1 for example. The numbers written on the remaining balls are 1,2,1,2.
From these balls, there are two ways to choose two distinct balls so that the integers written on them are equal.
Thus, the answer for k=1 is 2.
