Problem Statement
There is a slot machine with N reels.
The placement of symbols on the i-th reel is represented by a string S_i of length 10 containing each of 0, 1, ldots, 9 exactly once.
Each reel has a corresponding button. For each non-negative integer t, Takahashi can press one of the buttons of his choice (or do nothing) t seconds after the reels start spinning.
If the button for the i-th reel is pressed t seconds after the start of the spin, the i-th reel will stop to display the ((tbmod{10})+1)-th character of S_i.
Here, tbmod{10} denotes the remainder when t is divided by 10.
Takahashi wants to stop all reels to make them display the same character.
Find the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve his objective after the start of the spin.

Takahashi can make all reels display 8 in 6 seconds after the start of the spin by stopping them as follows.
0 seconds after the start of the spin, press the button for the 2-nd reel, making it stop to display the ((0bmod{10})+1=1)-st character of S_2, 8.
2 seconds after the start of the spin, press the button for the 3-rd reel, making it stop to display the ((2bmod{10})+1=3)-rd character of S_3, 8.
6 seconds after the start of the spin, press the button for the 1-st reel, making it stop to display the ((6bmod{10})+1=7)-th character of S_1, 8.
There is no way to make all reels display the same character in five seconds or less, so the answer is 6.
