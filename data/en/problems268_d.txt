Problem Statement
Takahashi is having trouble with deciding a username for a service.  Write a code to help him.
Find a string X that satisfies all of the following conditions:
X is obtained by the following procedure:
Let S_1', S_2', ldots,S_N' be a permutation of S_1, S_2, ldots,S_N.  Let X be the concatenation of S_1', (1 or more copies of _), S_2', (1 or more copies of _), ldots, (1 or more copies of _), and S_N', in this order.
The length of X is between 3 and 16, inclusive.
X does not coincide with any of M strings T_1,T_2,ldots,T_M.
If there is no X that satisfies all of the conditions, print -1 instead.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 8
0 ≦ M ≦ 10^5
N and M are integers.
1 ≦ |S_i| ≦ 16
N-1+sum{|S_i|} ≦ 16
S_i neq S_j if i neq j.
S_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
3 ≦ |T_i| ≦ 16
T_i neq T_j if i neq j.
T_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and _.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
S_1
S_2
vdots
S_N
T_1
T_2
vdots
T_M

Output
Print a string X that satisfies all of the conditions.  If there is no X that satisfies all of the conditions, print -1 instead.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Sample Input 1
1 1
chokudai
chokudai

Sample Output 1
-1
The only string that satisfies the first and second conditions is X= chokudai, but it coincides with T_1.
Thus, there is no X that satisfies all of the conditions, so -1 should be printed.

Sample Input 2
2 2
choku
dai
chokudai
choku_dai

Sample Output 2
dai_choku
Strings like choku__dai (which has two _'s between choku and dai) also satisfy all of the conditions.

Sample Input 3
2 2
chokudai
atcoder
chokudai_atcoder
atcoder_chokudai

Sample Output 3
-1
chokudai__atcoder and atcoder__chokudai (which have two _'s between chokudai and atcoder) have a length of 17, which violates the second condition.

Sample Input 4
4 4
ab
cd
ef
gh
hoge
fuga
____
_ab_cd_ef_gh_

Sample Output 4
ab__ef___cd_gh
The given T_i may contain a string that cannot be obtained by the procedure described in the first condition.
