Problem Statement
You are given a sequence A = (A_1, A_2, dots, A_N) of length N.
You perform the following operation exactly K times:
remove the initial element of A and append a 0 to the tail of A.
Print all the elements of A after the operations.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ K ≦ 100
1 ≦ A_i ≦ 100
All values in the input are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 dots A_N

Output
Print the elements of A after the operations in one line, separated by spaces.

Sample Input 1
3 2
2 7 8

Sample Output 1
8 0 0
Before the operations, A = (2, 7, 8).
After performing the operation once, A = (7, 8, 0).
After performing the operation twice, A = (8, 0, 0).
Thus, (8, 0, 0) is the answer.

Sample Input 2
3 4
9 9 9

Sample Output 2
0 0 0

Sample Input 3
9 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Sample Output 3
6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0
