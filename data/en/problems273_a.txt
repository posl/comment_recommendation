Problem Statement
A function f(x) defined for non-negative integer x satisfies the following conditions:
f(0) = 1;
f(k) = k times f(k-1) for all positive integers k.
Find f(N).

Constraints
N is an integer such that 0 le N le 10.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
2

Sample Output 1
2
We have f(2) = 2 times f(1) = 2 times 1 times f(0) = 2 times 1 times 1 = 2.

Sample Input 2
3

Sample Output 2
6
We have f(3) = 3 times f(2) = 3 times 2 = 6.

Sample Input 3
0

Sample Output 3
1
