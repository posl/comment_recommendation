Problem Statement
Given are an integer sequence A of length N, and an integer X.
Remove all elements that are equal to X from A, and arrange the remaining elements without changing the order to obtain the sequence A'. Print A'.

Constraints
1 le N le 10^5
1 le X le 10^9
1 le A_i le 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X
A_1 A_2 A_3 dots A_N

Output
Print the elements of A' in order, with space in between.

Sample Input 1
5 5
3 5 6 5 4

Sample Output 1
3 6 4
Removing 5s from [3, 5, 6, 5, 4] results in [3, 6, 4].

Sample Input 2
3 3
3 3 3

Sample Output 2
A' can be a sequence with zero elements, in which case we should just print an empty line.
