Problem Statement
You are given strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters and ?.  Here, |S| > |T| holds (for a string X, |X| denotes the length of X).
Two strings X and Y such that |X|=|Y| is said to match if and only if:
one can make X equal Y by replacing each ? in X and Y with any English letter independently.
Solve the following problem for each x=0,1,...,|T|:
Let S' be the string of length |T| obtained by concatenating the first x characters and the last (|T|-x) characters of S without changing the order.  Print Yes if S' and T match, and No otherwise.

Constraints
S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and ?.
1 ≦ |T| <  |S| ≦ 3 × 10^5

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

Output
Print (|T|+1) lines.
The i-th line should contain the answer for x=i-1.

Sample Input 1
a?c
b?

Sample Output 1
Yes
No
No
When x=0, S' equals ?c.  Here, we can replace the 1-st character of S', ?, with b and the 2-nd character of T, ?, with c to make S' equal T, so S' and T match.  Thus, Yes should be printed in the first line.
When x=1 and 2, respectively, S' is ac and a?, neither of which matches with T.  Thus, No should be printed in the second and third lines.
