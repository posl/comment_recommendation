Problem Statement
There is a knight - the chess piece - at the origin (0, 0) of a two-dimensional grid.
When the knight is at the square (i, j), it can be moved to either (i+1,j+2) or (i+2, j+1).
In how many ways can the knight reach the square (X, Y)?
Find the number of ways modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints
1 ≦ X ≦ 10^6
1 ≦ Y ≦ 10^6
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y

Output
Print the number of ways for the knight to reach (X, Y) from (0, 0), modulo 10^9 + 7.

Sample Input 1
3 3

Sample Output 1
2
There are two ways: (0,0) to (1,2) to (3,3) and (0,0) to (2,1) to (3,3).

Sample Input 2
2 2

Sample Output 2
0
The knight cannot reach (2,2).
