Problem Statement
You are given integers a, b, c, and d. Print two lines as follows.
The first line should contain the result of calculating (a + b) × (c - d) as an integer.
The second line should contain Takahashi, regardless of the input.

Constraints
-100 ≦ a, b, c, d ≦ 100
a, b, c, and d are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b c d 

Output
Print two lines according to the Problem Statement.

Sample Input 1
1 2 5 3

Sample Output 1
6
Takahashi
We have (1 + 2) ×(5 - 3) = 3 × 2 = 6, so the first line should contain 6.
The second line should contain Takahashi. Lowercasing the first character or incorrect spelling will not be accepted, so be careful.

Sample Input 2
10 -20 30 -40

Sample Output 2
-700
Takahashi
The input or output may contain negative numbers.

Sample Input 3
100 100 100 -100

Sample Output 3
40000
Takahashi
