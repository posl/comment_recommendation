Problem Statement
Takahashi has N balls. Each ball has an integer not less than 2 written on it. He will insert them in a cylinder one by one. The integer written on the i-th ball is a_i.
The balls are made of special material. When k balls with k (k ≧ 2) written on them line up in a row, all these k balls will disappear.
For each i (1 ≦ i ≦ N), find the number of balls after inserting the i-th ball.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2 × 10^5
2 ≦ a_i ≦ 2 × 10^5  (1 ≦ i ≦ N)
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 ... a_N

Output
Print N lines. The i-th line (1 ≦ i ≦ N) should contain the number of balls after inserting the i-th ball.

The content of the cylinder changes as follows.
After inserting the 1-st ball, the cylinder contains the ball with 3.
After inserting the 2-nd ball, the cylinder contains 3, 2 from bottom to top.
After inserting the 3-rd ball, the cylinder contains 3, 2, 3 from bottom to top.
After inserting the 4-th ball, the cylinder contains 3, 2, 3, 2 from bottom to top.
After inserting the 5-th ball, the cylinder momentarily has 3, 2, 3, 2, 2 from bottom to top. The two consecutive balls with 2 disappear, and the cylinder eventually contains 3, 2, 3 from bottom to top.
