Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of length N: A=(A_1,...,A_N).
Answer Q queries given in the following format.
You are given integers L, R, and X.
Find the number of elements among A_L, ..., A_R whose values are equal to X.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2× 10^5
1 ≦ A_i ≦ N
1 ≦ Q ≦ 2× 10^5
1≦ L ≦ R ≦ N, 1 ≦ X ≦ N, for each query.
All values in input are integers.

In the first query, two of (A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4,A_5) =(3,1,4,1,5) have values equal to 1.
In the second query, zero of (A_2,A_3,A_4) =(1,4,1) have values equal to 3.
