Problem Statement
Takahashi is making a computer baseball game.
He will write a program that shows a batter's batting average with a specified number of digits.
There are integers A and B, which satisfy 1 ≦ A ≦ 10 and 0 ≦ B ≦ A.
Let S be the string obtained as follows.
Round off dfrac{B}{A} to three decimal digits, then write the integer part (1 digit), . (the decimal point), and the decimal part (3 digits) in this order, with trailing zeros.
For example, if A=7 and B=4, then dfrac{B}{A} = dfrac{4}{7} = 0.571428dots rounded off to three decimal digits is 0.571. Thus, S is 0.571.
You are given A and B as the input and asked to print S.

Constraints
1 ≦ A ≦ 10
0 ≦ B ≦ A
A and B are integers.

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output
Print S in the format specified in the Problem Statement
. Note that answers in different formats will be considered wrong.

Sample Input 1
7 4

Sample Output 1
0.571
As explained in the Problem Statement
, dfrac{B}{A} = dfrac{4}{7} = 0.571428dots rounded off to three decimal digits is 0.571. Thus, S is 0.571.

Sample Input 2
7 3

Sample Output 2
0.429
dfrac{B}{A} = dfrac{3}{7} = 0.428571dots rounded off to three decimal digits is 0.429. (Note that it got rounded up.)
Thus, S is 0.429.

Sample Input 3
2 1

Sample Output 3
0.500
dfrac{B}{A} = dfrac{1}{2} = 0.5 rounded off to three decimal digits is again 0.5.
Thus, S is 0.500. Note that it must have three decimal places.

Sample Input 4
10 10

Sample Output 4
1.000

Sample Input 51 0

Sample Output
 50.000
