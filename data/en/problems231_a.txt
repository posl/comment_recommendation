Problem Statement
Let us assume that water pressure depends only on depth and is dfrac{x}{100} megapascal at a depth of x meters.
What is the water pressure in megapascals at a depth of D meters?

Constraints
1 ≦ D ≦ 10000
D is an integer.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
D

Output
Print the answer. Your output will be considered correct when its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-3}.

Sample Input 1
1000

Sample Output 1
10
The water pressure at a depth of 1000 meters is 10 megapascal. Output
s such as 10.0 and 9.999999 would also be accepted.

Sample Input 2
50

Sample Output 2
0.5

Sample Input 3
3141

Sample Output 3
31.41
