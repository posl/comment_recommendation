Problem Statement
You are given a 4-digit PIN: X_1X_2X_3X_4, which may begin with a 0.
The PIN is said to be weak when it satisfies one of the following conditions:
All of the four digits are the same.
For each integer i such that 1≦ i≦ 3, X_{i+1} follows X_i. Here, j+1 follows j for each 0≦ j≦ 8, and 0 follows 9.
If the given PIN is weak, print Weak; otherwise, print Strong.

Constraints
0 ≦ X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4 ≦ 9
X_1, X_2, X_3, and X_4 are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X_1X_2X_3X_4

Output
If the given PIN is weak, print Weak; otherwise, print Strong.

Sample Input 1
7777

Sample Output 1
Weak
All four digits are 7, satisfying the first condition, so this PIN is weak.

Sample Input 2
0112

Sample Output 2
Strong
The first and second digits differ, and the third digit does not follow the second digit, so neither condition is satisfied.

Sample Input 3
9012

Sample Output 3
Weak
Note that 0 follows 9.
