Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer X, perform the following operation for i=1,2,dots,K in this order and find the resulting X.
Round X off to the nearest 10^i.
Formally, replace X with Y that is "the largest multiple of 10^i that minimizes |Y-X|."
Here are some examples:
Rounding 273 off to the nearest 10^2 yields 300.
Rounding 999 off to the nearest 10^3 yields 1000.
Rounding 100 off to the nearest 10^{10} yields 0.
Rounding 1015 off to the nearest 10^1 yields 1020.



Constraints
X and K are integers.
0 le X < 10^{15}
1 le K le 15

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X K

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
2048 2

Sample Output 1
2100
X changes as 2048 rightarrow 2050 rightarrow 2100 by the operations.

Sample Input 2
1 15

Sample Output 2
0

Sample Input 3
999 3

Sample Output 3
1000

Sample Input 4
314159265358979 12

Sample Output 4
314000000000000
X may not fit into a 32-bit integer type.
