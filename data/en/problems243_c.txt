Problem Statement
There are N people in an xy-plane. Person i is at (X_i, Y_i). The positions of all people are different.
We have a string S of length N consisting of L and R.
If S_i = R, Person i is facing right; if S_i = L, Person i is facing left. All people simultaneously start walking in the direction they are facing. Here, right and left correspond to the positive and negative x-direction, respectively.
For example, the figure below shows the movement of people when (X_1, Y_1) = (2, 3), (X_2, Y_2) = (1, 1), (X_3, Y_3) =(4, 1), S = RRL.
We say that there is a collision when two people walking in opposite directions come to the same position. Will there be a collision if all people continue walking indefinitely?

Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 2 times 10^5
0 ≦ X_i ≦ 10^9
0 ≦ Y_i ≦ 10^9
(X_i, Y_i) neq (X_j, Y_j) if i neq j.
All X_i and Y_i are integers.
S is a string of length N consisting of L and R.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output
If there will be a collision, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

RRL

Sample Output 1
Yes
This input corresponds to the example in the Problem Statement
.
If all people continue walking, Person 2 and Person 3 will collide. Thus, Yes should be printed.

Sample Output 2
No
Since Person 1 and Person 2 walk in the same direction, they never collide.
