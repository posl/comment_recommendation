Problem Statement
You are given N non-negative integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N and another non-negative integer K.
For a integer X between 0 and K (inclusive), let f(X) = (X XOR A_1) + (X XOR A_2) + ... + (X XOR A_N).
Here, for non-negative integers a and b, a XOR b denotes the bitwise exclusive OR of a and b.
Find the maximum value of f.
What is XOR?
The bitwise exclusive OR of a and b, X, is defined as follows:
When X is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k ≧ 0) is 1 if, when written in base two, exactly one of A and B has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.
For example, 3 XOR 5 = 6. (When written in base two: 011 XOR 101 = 110.)

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
0 ≦ K ≦ 10^{12}
0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^{12}

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output
Print the maximum value of f.

Sample Input 1
3 7
1 6 3

Sample Output 1
14
The maximum value is: f(4) = (4 XOR 1) + (4 XOR 6) + (4 XOR 3) = 5 + 2 + 7 = 14.

Sample Input 2
4 9
7 4 0 3

Sample Output 2
46

Sample Input 3
1 0
1000000000000

Sample Output 3
1000000000000
