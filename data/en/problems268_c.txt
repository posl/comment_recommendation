Problem Statement
Person 0, Person 1, ldots, and Person (N-1) are sitting around a turntable in their counterclockwise order, evenly spaced.  Dish p_i is in front of Person i on the table.
You may perform the following operation 0 or more times:
Rotate the turntable by one N-th of a counterclockwise turn.  As a result, the dish that was in front of Person i right before the rotation is now in front of Person (i+1) bmod N.
When you are finished, Person i is happy if Dish i is in front of Person (i-1) bmod N, Person i, or Person (i+1) bmod N.
Find the maximum possible number of happy people.
 What is a bmod m?  For an integer a and a positive integer m, a bmod m denotes the integer x between 0 and (m-1) (inclusive) such that (a-x) is a multiple of m.  (It can be proved that such x is unique.)

Constraints
3 ≦ N ≦ 2 times 10^5
0 ≦ p_i ≦ N-1
p_i neq p_j if i neq j.
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:

The figure below shows the table after one operation.
Here, there are four happy people:
Person 0 is happy because Dish 0 is in front of Person 3 (=(0-1) bmod 4);
Person 1 is happy because Dish 1 is in front of Person 1 (=1);
Person 2 is happy because Dish 2 is in front of Person 2 (=2);
Person 3 is happy because Dish 3 is in front of Person 0 (=(3+1) bmod 4).
There cannot be five or more happy people, so the answer is 4.
