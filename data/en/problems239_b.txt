Problem Statement
Given an integer X between -10^{18} and 10^{18} (inclusive), print leftlfloor dfrac{X}{10} rightrfloor.

Notes
For a real number x, leftlfloor x rightrfloor denotes "the maximum integer not exceeding x".  For example, we have leftlfloor 4.7 rightrfloor = 4, leftlfloor -2.4 rightrfloor = -3, and leftlfloor 5 rightrfloor = 5.  (For more details, please refer to the description in the Sample Input and Output
.)

Constraints
-10^{18} ≦ X ≦ 10^{18}
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X

Output
Print leftlfloor frac{X}{10} rightrfloor.  Note that it should be output as an integer.

Sample Input 1
47

Sample Output 1
4
The integers that do not exceed frac{47}{10} = 4.7 are all the negative integers, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  The maximum integer among them is 4, so we have leftlfloor frac{47}{10} rightrfloor = 4.

Sample Input 2
-24

Sample Output 2
-3
Since the maximum integer not exceeding frac{-24}{10} = -2.4 is -3, we have leftlfloor frac{-24}{10} rightrfloor = -3.
Note that -2 does not satisfy the condition, as -2 exceeds -2.4.

Sample Input 3
50

Sample Output 3
5
The maximum integer that does not exceed frac{50}{10} = 5 is 5 itself.  Thus, we have leftlfloor frac{50}{10} rightrfloor = 5.

Sample Input 4
-30

Sample Output 4
-3
Just like the previous example, leftlfloor frac{-30}{10} rightrfloor = -3.

Sample Input 5987654321987654321

Sample Output
 598765432198765432
The answer is 98765432198765432.  Make sure that all the digits match.
