Problem Statement
AtCoDeer the deer found two rectangles lying on the table, each with height 1 and width W.
If we consider the surface of the desk as a two-dimensional plane, the first rectangle covers the vertical range of [0,1] and the horizontal range of [a,a+W], and the second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W], as shown in the following figure:
AtCoDeer will move the second rectangle horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle.
Find the minimum distance it needs to be moved.

Constraints
All input values are integers.
1≤W≤10^5
1≤a,b≤10^5

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
W a b

Output
Print the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved.

Sample Input 1
3 2 6

Sample Output 1
1
This input corresponds to the figure in the statement. In this case, the second rectangle should be moved to the left by a distance of 1.

Sample Input 2
3 1 3

Sample Output 2
0
The rectangles are already connected, and thus no move is needed.

Sample Input 3
5 10 1

Sample Output 3
4
