Problem Statement
We have an empty sequence A.
Given Q queries, process them in order.
Each query is of one of the following three types.  
1 x : Insert x to A.  
2 x k : Among the elements of A that are less than or equal to x, print the k-th largest value.  (k is no more than bf{5})
    If there are less than k elements of A that are less than or equal to x, then print -1.
3 x k : Among the elements of A that are greater than or equal to x, print the k-th smallest value.  (k is no more than bf{5})
    If there are less than k elements of A that are greater than or equal to x, then print -1.


Constraints
1≦ Q ≦ 2times 10^5
1≦ x≦ 10^{18}
1≦ k≦ 5
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
Q
text{query}_1
text{query}_2
vdots
text{query}_Q
In the i-th query text{query}_i, the type of query c_i (which is either 1, 2, or 3) is given first.
If c_i=1, then x is additionally given; if c_i=2, 3, then x and k are additionally given.
In other words, each query is given in one of the following three formats:  
1 x
2 x k
3 x k

Output
Print q lines, where q is the number of queries such that c_i=2,3.
The j-th line (1≦ j≦ q) should contain the answer for the j-th such query.

After text{query}_{1,2,3,4} have been processed, we have A=(20,10,30,20).  
For text{query}_{5,6,7}, the elements of A greater than or equal to 15 are (20,30,20).
The 1-st smallest value of them is 20; the 2-nd is 20; the 3-rd is 30.
