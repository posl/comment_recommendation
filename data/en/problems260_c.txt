Problem Statement
Takahashi has a red jewel of level N.  (He has no other jewels.) 
Takahashi can do the following operations any number of times.
Convert a red jewel of level n (n is at least 2) into "a red jewel of level (n-1) and X blue jewels of level n".
Convert a blue jewel of level n (n is at least 2) into "a red jewel of level (n-1) and Y blue jewels of level (n-1)".
Takahashi wants as many blue jewels of level 1 as possible.  At most, how many blue jewels of level 1 can he obtain by the operations?

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10
1 ≦ X ≦ 5
1 ≦ Y ≦ 5
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X Y

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
2 3 4

Sample Output 1
12
Takahashi can obtain 12 blue jewels of level 1 by the following conversions.
First, he converts a red jewel of level 2 into a red jewel of level 1 and 3 blue jewels of level 2.
After this operation, Takahashi has 1 red jewel of level 1 and 3 blue jewels of level 2.
Next, he repeats the following conversion 3 times: converting a blue jewel of level 2 into a red jewel of level 1 and 4 blue jewels of level 1.
After these operations, Takahashi has 4 red jewels of level 1 and 12 blue jewels of level 1.
He cannot perform a conversion anymore.
He cannot obtain more than 12 blue jewels of level 1, so the answer is 12.

Sample Input 2
1 5 5

Sample Output 2
0
Takahashi may not be able to obtain a blue jewel of level 1.

Sample Input 3
10 5 5

Sample Output 3
3942349900
Note that the answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer type.
