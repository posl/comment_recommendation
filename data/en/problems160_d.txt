Problem Statement
We have an undirected graph G with N vertices numbered 1 to N and N edges as follows:
For each i=1,2,...,N-1, there is an edge between Vertex i and Vertex i+1.
There is an edge between Vertex X and Vertex Y.
For each k=1,2,...,N-1, solve the problem below:
Find the number of pairs of integers (i,j) (1 ≦ i < j ≦ N) such that the shortest distance between Vertex i and Vertex j in G is k.

Constraints
3 ≦ N ≦ 2 times 10^3
1 ≦ X,Y ≦ N
X+1 < Y
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output
For each k=1, 2, ..., N-1 in this order, print a line containing the answer to the problem.
