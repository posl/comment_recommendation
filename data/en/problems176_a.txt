Problem Statement
Takahashi loves takoyaki - a ball-shaped snack.
With a takoyaki machine, he can make at most X pieces of takoyaki at a time, taking T minutes regardless of the number of pieces to make.
How long does it take to make N takoyaki?

Constraints
1 ≦ N,X,T ≦ 1000
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X T

Output
Print an integer representing the minimum number of minutes needed to make N pieces of takoyaki.

Sample Input 1
20 12 6

Sample Output 1
12
He can make 12 pieces of takoyaki in the first 6 minutes and 8 more in the next 6 minutes, so he can make 20 in a total of 12 minutes.
Note that being able to make 12 in 6 minutes does not mean he can make 2 in 1 minute.

Sample Input 2
1000 1 1000

Sample Output 2
1000000
It seems to take a long time to make this kind of takoyaki.
