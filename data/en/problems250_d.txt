Problem Statement
Let us regard an integer k as "similar to 250" if the following condition is satisfied:
k is represented as k=p times q^3 with primes p<q.
How many integers less than or equal to N are "similar to 250"?

Constraints
N is an integer between 1 and 10^{18} (inclusive)

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
250

Sample Output 1
2
54 = 2 times 3^3 is "similar to 250".
250 = 2 times 5^3 is "similar to 250".
The two integers above are all the integers "similar to 250".

Sample Input 2
1

Sample Output 2
0
