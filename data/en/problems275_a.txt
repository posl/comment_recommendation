Problem Statement
There are N bridges in AtCoder Village. The height of the bridge numbered i is H_i (i is an integer between 1 and N).
Every two different bridges in the village have different heights.
Print the number representing the highest bridge in the village.

Constraints
1≦ N ≦ 100
1≦ H_i ≦ 10^9
All H_i are different.
All values in the input are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
H_1 H_2 ... H_N

Output
Print the integer representing the highest bridge in AtCoder village.

Sample Input 1
3
50 80 70

Sample Output 1
2
The village has three bridges.
The first, second, and third bridges have heights of 50, 80, and 70, respectively,
so the second bridge is the highest.
Thus, 2 should be printed.

Sample Input 2
1
1000000000

Sample Output 2
