Problem Statement
Given are integers a,b,c and d.
If x and y are integers and a ≦ x ≦ b and c≦ y ≦ d hold, what is the maximum possible value of x times y?

Constraints
-10^9 ≦ a ≦ b ≦ 10^9
-10^9 ≦ c ≦ d ≦ 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b c d

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
1 2 1 1

Sample Output 1
2
If x = 1 and y = 1 then x times y = 1.
If x = 2 and y = 1 then x times y = 2.
Therefore, the answer is 2.

Sample Input 2
3 5 -4 -2

Sample Output 2
-6
The answer can be negative.

Sample Input 3
-1000000000 0 -1000000000 0

Sample Output 3
1000000000000000000
