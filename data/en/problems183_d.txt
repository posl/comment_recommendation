Problem Statement
We have a water heater, which supplies W liters of hot water per minute.
There are N people. The i-th person plans to use P_i liters of hot water per minute boiled by the heater from Time S_i to T_i (excluding at Time T_i exactly). As hot water gets cold fast, it cannot be stored.
Is it possible to supply hot water to the people according to their plans?
