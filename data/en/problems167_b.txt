Problem Statement
We have A cards, each of which has an integer 1 written on it. Similarly, we also have B cards with 0s and C cards with -1s.
We will pick up K among these cards. What is the maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen?

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
0 ≦ A, B, C
1 ≦ K ≦ A + B + C ≦ 2 times 10^9

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C K

Output
Print the maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen.

Sample Input 1
2 1 1 3

Sample Output 1
2
Consider picking up two cards with 1s and one card with a 0.
In this case, the sum of the numbers written on the cards is 2, which is the maximum possible value.

Sample Input 2
1 2 3 4

Sample Output 2
0

Sample Input 3
2000000000 0 0 2000000000
