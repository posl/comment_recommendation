Problem Statement
Given are N strings S_1,...,S_N, each of which is AND or OR.
Find the number of tuples of N+1 variables (x_0,...,x_N), where each element is True or False, such that the following computation results in y_N being True:
y_0=x_0;
for i≧ 1, y_i=y_{i-1} land x_i if S_i is AND, and y_i=y_{i-1} lor x_i if S_i is OR.
Here, a land b and a lor b are logical operators.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 60
S_i is AND or OR.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1
.
.
.
S_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
2
AND
OR

Sample Output 1
5
For example, if (x_0,x_1,x_2)=(True,False,True), we have y_2 = True, as follows:
y_0=x_0=True
y_1=y_0 land x_1 = True land False=False
y_2=y_1 lor x_2 = False lor True=True
All of the five tuples (x_0,x_1,x_2) resulting in y_2 = True are shown below:
(True,True,True)
(True,True,False)
(True,False,True)
(False,True,True)
(False,False,True)

Sample Input 2
5
OR

Sample Output 2
63
All tuples except the one filled entirely with False result in y_5 = True.
