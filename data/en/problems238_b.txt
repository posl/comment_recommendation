Problem Statement
We have a circular pizza.
Takahashi will cut this pizza using a sequence A of length N, according to the following procedure.
First, make a cut from the center in the 12 o'clock direction.
Next, do N operations. The i-th operation is as follows.
Rotate the pizza A_i degrees clockwise.
Then, make a cut from the center in the 12 o'clock direction.

For example, if A=(90,180,45,195), the procedure cuts the pizza as follows.
Find the center angle of the largest pizza after the procedure.

Constraints
