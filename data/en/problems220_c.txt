Problem Statement
We have a sequence of N positive integers: A=(A_1,dots,A_N).
Let B be the concatenation of 10^{100} copies of A.
Consider summing up the terms of B from left to right. When does the sum exceed X for the first time?
In other words, find the minimum integer k such that:
displaystyle{sum_{i=1}^{k} B_i gt X}.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9
1 ≦ X ≦ 10^{18}
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 ldots A_N
X

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
3
3 5 2
26

Sample Output 1
8
We have B=(3,5,2,3,5,2,3,5,2,dots).
displaystyle{sum_{i=1}^{8} B_i = 28 gt 26} holds, but the condition is not satisfied when k is 7 or less, so the answer is 8.
