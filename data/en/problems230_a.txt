Problem Statement
AtCoder Grand Contest (AGC), a regularly held contest with a world authority, has been held 54 times.
Just like the 230-th ABC ― the one you are in now ― is called ABC230, the N-th AGC is initially named with a zero-padded 3-digit number N. (The 1-st AGC is AGC001, the 2-nd AGC is AGC002, ...)
However, the latest 54-th AGC is called AGC055, where the number is one greater than 54. Because AGC042 is canceled and missing due to the social situation, the 42-th and subsequent contests are assigned numbers that are one greater than the numbers of contests held. (See also the explanations at Sample Inputs and Outputs
.)
Here is the problem: given an integer N, print the name of the N-th AGC in the format AGCXXX, where XXX is the zero-padded 3-digit number.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 54
N is an integer.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the name of the N-th AGC in the specified format.

Sample Input 1
42

Sample Output 1
AGC043
As explained in Problem Statement, the 42-th and subsequent AGCs are assigned numbers that are one greater than the numbers of contests.
Thus, the 42-th AGC is named AGC043.

Sample Input 2
19

Sample Output 2
AGC019
The 41-th and preceding AGCs are assigned numbers that are equal to the numbers of contests.
Thus, the answer is AGC019.

Sample Input 3
1

Sample Output 3
AGC001
As mentioned in Problem Statement, the 1-st AGC is named AGC001.
Be sure to pad the number with zeros into a 3-digit number.

Sample Input 4
50

Sample Output 4
AGC051
