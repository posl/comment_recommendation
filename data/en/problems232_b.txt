Problem Statement
Takahashi has a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.
On this string, he will do the operation below just once.
First, choose a non-negative integer K.
Then, shift each character of S to the right by K (see below).
Here,
a shifted to the right by 1 is b;
b shifted to the right by 1 is c;
c shifted to the right by 1 is d;
cdots
y shifted to the right by 1 is z;
z shifted to the right by 1 is a.
For example, b shifted to the right by 4 is f, and y shifted to the right by 3 is b.
You are given a string T.
Determine whether Takahashi can make S equal T by the operation above.

Constraints
Each of S and T is a string of length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.
The lengths of S and T are equal.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

Output
If Takahashi can make S equal T, print Yes; if not, print No.

Sample Input 1
abc
ijk

Sample Output 1
Yes
When Takahashi chooses K=8,
a is shifted to the right by 8 and becomes i,
b is shifted to the right by 8 and becomes j,
c is shifted to the right by 8 and becomes k,
and now S and T are equal.
Therefore, he can make S equal T, so Yes should be printed.

Sample Input 2
z
a

Sample Output 2
Yes
Choosing K=1 makes S and T equal.
Note that the letter on the right of z is a.

Sample Input 3
ppq
qqp

Sample Output 3
No
There is no non-negative integer K that he can choose to make S equal T, so No should be printed.

Sample Input 4
atcoder
atcoder

Sample Output 4
Yes
Choosing K=0 makes S and T equal.
