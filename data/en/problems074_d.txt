Problem Statement
In Takahashi Kingdom, which once existed, there are N cities, and some pairs of cities are connected bidirectionally by roads.
The following are known about the road network:
People traveled between cities only through roads. It was possible to reach any city from any other city, via intermediate cities if necessary.
Different roads may have had different lengths, but all the lengths were positive integers.
Snuke the archeologist found a table with N rows and N columns, A, in the ruin of Takahashi Kingdom.
He thought that it represented the shortest distances between the cities along the roads in the kingdom.
Determine whether there exists a road network such that for each u and v, the integer A_{u, v} at the u-th row and v-th column of A is equal to the length of the shortest path from City u to City v.
If such a network exist, find the shortest possible total length of the roads.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 300
If i ≠ j, 1 ≦ A_{i, j} = A_{j, i} ≦ 10^9.
A_{i, i} = 0

InputsInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} ... A_{1, N}
A_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} ... A_{2, N}
...
A_{N, 1} A_{N, 2} ... A_{N, N}

Output
sIf there exists no network that satisfies the condition, print -1.
If it exists, print the shortest possible total length of the roads.

The network below satisfies the condition:
City 1 and City 2 is connected by a road of length 1.
City 2 and City 3 is connected by a road of length 2.
City 3 and City 1 is not connected by a road.

Sample Input 2
3
0 1 3
1 0 1
3 1 0

Sample Output 2
-1
As there is a path of length 1 from City 1 to City 2 and City 2 to City 3, there is a path of length 2 from City 1 to City 3.
However, according to the table, the shortest distance between City 1 and City 3 must be 3.
Thus, we conclude that there exists no network that satisfies the condition.
