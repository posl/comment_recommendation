Problem Statement
For real numbers L and R, let us denote by [L,R) the set of real numbers greater than or equal to L and less than R.  Such a set is called a right half-open interval.
You are given N right half-open intervals [L_i,R_i).  Let S be their union.  Represent S as a union of the minimum number of right half-open intervals.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2times 10^5
1 ≦ L_i < R_i ≦ 2times 10^5
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
L_1 R_1
vdots
L_N R_N

Output
Let k be the minimum number of right half-open intervals needed to represent S as their union.   Print k lines containing such k right half-open intervals [X_i,Y_i) in ascending order of X_i, as follows:
X_1 Y_1
vdots
X_k Y_k

Sample Input 1
3
10 20
20 30
40 50

Sample Output 1
10 30
40 50
The union of the three right half-open intervals [10,20),[20,30),[40,50) equals the union of two right half-open intervals [10,30),[40,50).

Sample Input 2
3
10 40

20 50

Sample Output 2
10 60
The union of the three right half-open intervals [10,40),[30,60),[20,50) equals the union of one right half-open interval [10,60).
