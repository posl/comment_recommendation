Problem Statement
Given are positive integers N, M, Q, and Q quadruples of integers ( a_i , b_i , c_i , d_i ).
Consider a sequence A satisfying the following conditions:
A is a sequence of N positive integers.
1 ≦ A_1 ≦ A_2 le cdots ≦ A_N ≦ M.
Let us define a score of this sequence as follows:
The score is the sum of d_i over all indices i such that A_{b_i} - A_{a_i} = c_i. (If there is no such i, the score is 0.)
Find the maximum possible score of A.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
2 ≤ N ≤ 10
1 ≦ M ≦ 10
1 ≦ Q ≦ 50
1 ≦ a_i < b_i ≦ N ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )
0 ≦ c_i ≦ M - 1 ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )
(a_i, b_i, c_i) neq (a_j, b_j, c_j) (where i neq j)
1 ≦ d_i ≦ 10^5 ( i = 1, 2, ..., Q )

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M Q
a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1
:
a_Q b_Q c_Q d_Q

Output
Print the maximum possible score of A.

Sample Input 1
3 4 3
1 3 3 100
1 2 2 10
2 3 2 10

Sample Output 1
110
When A = {1, 3, 4}, its score is 110. Under these conditions, no sequence has a score greater than 110, so the answer is 110.
