Problem Statement
In programming, hexadecimal notation is often used.
In hexadecimal notation, besides the ten digits 0, 1, ..., 9, the six letters A, B, C, D, E and F are used to represent the values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively.
In this problem, you are given two letters X and Y. Each X and Y is A, B, C, D, E or F.
When X and Y are seen as hexadecimal numbers, which is larger?

Constraints
Each X and Y is A, B, C, D, E or F.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y

Output
If X is smaller, print <; if Y is smaller, print >; if they are equal, print =.
