Problem Statement
You are given a sequence A=(A_1,A_2,ldots,A_N) of length N consisting of non-negative integers.
Determine if there is an even number represented as the sum of two different elements of A.  If it exists, find the maximum such number.

Constraints
2≦ N ≦ 2times 10^5
0≦ A_i≦ 10^9
The elements of A are distinct.
All values in the input are integers.

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ldots A_N

Output
Print -1 if there is no even number represented as the sum of two different elements of A.
If such an even number exists, print the maximum such number.

Sample Input 1
3
2 3 4

Sample Output 1
6
The values represented as the sum of two distinct elements of A are 5, 6, and 7.  We have an even number here, and the maximum is 6.

Sample Input 2
2
1 0

Sample Output 2
-1
The value represented as the sum of two distinct elements of A is 1.  We have no even number here, so -1 should be printed.
