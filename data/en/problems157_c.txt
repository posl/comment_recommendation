Problem Statement
If there is an integer not less than 0 satisfying the following conditions, print the smallest such integer; otherwise, print -1.
The integer has exactly N digits in base ten. (We assume 0 to be a 1-digit integer. For other integers, leading zeros are not allowed.)
The s_i-th digit from the left is c_i. left(i = 1, 2, cdots, Mright)

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ N ≦ 3
0 ≦ M ≦ 5
1 ≦ s_i ≦ N
0 ≦ c_i ≦ 9

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
s_1 c_1
vdots
s_M c_M

Output
Print the answer.
