Problem Statement
There is a bar of chocolate with a height of H blocks and a width of W blocks.
Snuke is dividing this bar into exactly three pieces.
He can only cut the bar along borders of blocks, and the shape of each piece must be a rectangle.
Snuke is trying to divide the bar as evenly as possible.
More specifically, he is trying to minimize S_{max} - S_{min}, where S_{max} is the area (the number of blocks contained) of the largest piece, and S_{min} is the area of the smallest piece.
Find the minimum possible value of S_{max} - S_{min}.

Constraints
2 ≤ H, W ≤ 10^5

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W

Output
Print the minimum possible value of S_{max} - S_{min}.

Sample Input 1
3 5

Sample Output 1
0
In the division below, S_{max} - S_{min} = 5 - 5 = 0.


Sample Input 2
4 5

Sample Output 2
2
In the division below, S_{max} - S_{min} = 8 - 6 = 2.


Sample Input 3
5 5

Sample Output 3
4
In the division below, S_{max} - S_{min} = 10 - 6 = 4.
