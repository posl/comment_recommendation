Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer N.
We have a grid with N rows and N columns, where the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left has a digit A_{i,j} written on it.
Assume that the upper and lower edges of this grid are connected, as well as the left and right edges. In other words, all of the following holds.
(N,i) is just above (1,i), and (1,i) is just below (N,i). (1le ile N).
(i,N) is just to the left of (i,1), and (i,1) is just to the right of (i,N). (1le ile N).
Takahashi will first choose one of the following eight directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonal directions. Then, he will start on a square of his choice and repeat moving one square in the chosen direction N-1 times.
In this process, Takahashi visits N squares. Find the greatest possible value of the integer that is obtained by arranging the digits written on the squares visited by Takahashi from left to right in the order visited by him.

All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_{1,1}A_{1,2}dots A_{1,N}
A_{2,1}A_{2,2}dots A_{2,N}
vdots
A_{N,1}A_{N,2}dots A_{N,N}

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Output 1
9786
If Takahashi starts on the square at the 2-nd row from the top and 4-th column from the left and goes down and to the right, the integer obtained by arranging the digits written on the visited squares will be 9786.
It is impossible to make a value greater than 9786, so the answer is 9786.
