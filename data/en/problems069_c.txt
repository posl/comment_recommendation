Problem Statement
We have a sequence of length N, a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_N).
Each a_i is a positive integer.
Snuke's objective is to permute the element in a so that the following condition is satisfied:
For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1, the product of a_i and a_{i + 1} is a multiple of 4.
Determine whether Snuke can achieve his objective.

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
a_i is an integer.
1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

Output
If Snuke can achieve his objective, print Yes; otherwise, print No.
