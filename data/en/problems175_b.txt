Problem Statement
We have sticks numbered 1, cdots, N. The length of Stick i (1 ≦ i ≦ N) is L_i.
In how many ways can we choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle?
That is, find the number of triples of integers (i, j, k) (1 ≦ i < j < k ≦ N) that satisfy both of the following conditions:
L_i, L_j, and L_k are all different.
There exists a triangle whose sides have lengths L_i, L_j, and L_k.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ L_i ≦ 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
L_1 L_2 cdots L_N

Output
Print the number of ways to choose three of the sticks with different lengths that can form a triangle.

Sample Input 1
5
4 4 9 7 5

Sample Output 1
5
The following five triples (i, j, k) satisfy the conditions: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 5), and (3, 4, 5).

Sample Input 2
6
4 5 4 3 3 5

Sample Output 2
8
We have two sticks for each of the lengths 3, 4, and 5. To satisfy the first condition, we have to choose one from each length.
There is a triangle whose sides have lengths 3, 4, and 5, so we have 2 ^ 3 = 8 triples (i, j, k) that satisfy the conditions.

Sample Input 3
10
9 4 6 1 9 6 10 6 6 8

Sample Output 3
39

Sample Input 4
2
1 1

Sample Output 4
0
No triple (i, j, k) satisfies 1 ≦ i < j < k ≦ N, so we should print 0.
