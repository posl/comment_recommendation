Problem Statement
There are N people numbered 1,2,...,N.
M parties were held.  k_i people attended the i-th (1≦ i ≦ M) party, and they were People x_{i,1},x_{i,2},...,x_{i,k_i}.
Determine if every two people attended the same party at least once.

Constraints
2≦ N ≦ 100
1≦ M ≦ 100
2≦ k_i ≦ N
1≦ x_{i,1}<x_{i,2}<... < x_{i,k_i}≦ N
All values in the input are integers.
