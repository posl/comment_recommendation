Problem Statement
Given an integer N, solve the following problem.
Let f(x)= (The number of positive integers at most x with the same number of digits as x).
Find f(1)+f(2)+...+f(N) modulo 998244353.

Constraints
N is an integer.
1 â‰¦ N < 10^{18}

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
16

Sample Output 1
73
For a positive integer x between 1 and 9, the positive integers at most x with the same number of digits as x are 1,2,...,x.
Thus, we have f(1)=1,f(2)=2,...,f(9)=9.
For a positive integer x between 10 and 16, the positive integers at most x with the same number of digits as x are 10,11,...,x.
Thus, we have f(10)=1,f(11)=2,...,f(16)=7.

The final answer is 73.

Sample Input 2
238

Sample Output 2
13870

Sample Input 3
999999999999999999

Sample Output 3
