Problem Statement
For integers b (b geq 2) and n (n geq 1), let the function f(b,n) be defined as follows:
f(b,n) = n, when n < b
f(b,n) = f(b,,{rm floor}(n / b)) + (n  {rm mod}  b), when n geq b
Here, {rm floor}(n / b) denotes the largest integer not exceeding n / b,
and n  {rm mod}  b denotes the remainder of n divided by b.
Less formally, f(b,n) is equal to the sum of the digits of n written in base b.
For example, the following hold:
f(10,,87654)=8+7+6+5+4=30
f(100,,87654)=8+76+54=138
You are given integers n and s.
Determine if there exists an integer b (b geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s.
If the answer is positive, also find the smallest such b.

Constraints
1 ≦ n ≦ 10^{11}
1 ≦ s ≦ 10^{11}
n,,s are integers.

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
s

Output
If there exists an integer b (b geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s, print the smallest such b.
If such b does not exist, print -1 instead.
