Problem Statement
Takahashi is trying to create a game inspired by baseball, but he is having difficulty writing the code.
Write a program for Takahashi that solves the following problem.
There are 4 squares called Square 0, Square 1, Square 2, and Square 3.  Initially, all squares are empty.
There is also an integer P; initially, P = 0.
Given a sequence of positive integers A = (A_1, A_2, ..., A_N), perform the following operations for i = 1, 2, ..., N in this order:
Put a piece on Square 0.
Advance every piece on the squares A_i squares ahead.  In other words, if Square x has a piece, move the piece to Square (x + A_i).   
    If, however, the destination square does not exist (i.e. x + A_i is greater than or equal to 4) for a piece, remove it.  Add to P the number of pieces that have been removed.
Print the value of P after all the operations have been performed.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ A_i ≦ 4
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output
Print the value of P after all the operations have been performed.

Sample Input 1
4
1 1 3 2

Sample Output 1
3
The operations are described below.  After all the operations have been performed, P equals 3.
The operations for i=1:  
Put a piece on Square 0.  Now, Square 0 has a piece.
Advance every piece on the squares 1 square ahead.  After these moves, Square 1 has a piece.
The operations for i=2:  
Put a piece on Square 0.  Now, Squares 0 and 1 have a piece.
Advance every piece on the squares 1 square ahead.  After these moves, Squares 1 and 2 have a piece.
The operations for i=3:  
Put a piece on Square 0.  Now, Squares 0, 1, and 2 have a piece.
Advance every piece on the squares 3 squares ahead.
Here, for the pieces on Squares 1 and 2, the destination squares do not exist (since 1+3=4 and 2+3=5), so remove these pieces and add 2 to P.  P now equals 2.
After these moves, Square 3 has a piece.
The operations for i=4:  
Put a piece on Square 0.  Now, Squares 0 and 3 have a piece.
Advance every piece on the squares 2 squares ahead.
Here, for the piece on Square 3, the destination square does not exist (since 3+2=5), so remove this piece and add 1 to P.  P now equals 3.
After these moves, Square 2 has a piece.
