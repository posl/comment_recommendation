Problem Statement
We have a multiset of integers S, which is initially empty.
Given Q queries, process them in order.
Each query is of one of the following types.
1 x: Insert an x into S.
2 x c: Remove an x from S m times, where m = mathrm{min}(c,( the number of x's contained in S)).
3 : Print ( maximum value of S)-( minimum value of S).  It is guaranteed that S is not empty when this query is given.


Constraints
1 ≦ Q ≦ 2times 10^5
0 ≦ x ≦ 10^9
1 ≦ c ≦ Q
When a query of type 3 is given, S is not empty.
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
Q
mathrm{query}_1
vdots
mathrm{query}_Q
mathrm{query}_i, which denotes the i-th query, is in one of the following formats:
1 x
2 x c
3 

Output
Print the answers for the queries of type 3 in the given order, separated by newlines.

The multiset S transitions as follows.
1-st query: insert 3 into S.  S is now lbrace 3 rbrace.
2-nd query: insert 2 into S.  S is now lbrace 2, 3 rbrace.
3-rd query: the maximum value of S = lbrace  2, 3rbrace is 3 and its minimum value is 2, so print 3-2=1.
4-th query: insert 2 into S.  S is now lbrace 2,2,3 rbrace.
5-th query: insert 7 into S.  S is now lbrace 2, 2,3, 7rbrace.
6-th query: the maximum value of S = lbrace 2,2,3, 7rbrace is 7 and its minimum value is 2, so print 7-2=5.
7-th query: since there are two 2's in S and mathrm{min(2,3)} = 2, remove 2 from S twice.  S is now lbrace 3, 7rbrace.
8-th query: the maximum value of S = lbrace 3, 7rbrace is 7 and its minimum value is 3, so print 7-3=4.

Sample Output 2
If the given queries do not contain that of type 3, nothing should be printed.
