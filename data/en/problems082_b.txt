Problem Statement
You are given strings s and t, consisting of lowercase English letters.
You will create a string s' by freely rearranging the characters in s.
You will also create a string t' by freely rearranging the characters in t.
Determine whether it is possible to satisfy s' < t' for the lexicographic order.

Notes
For a string a = a_1 a_2 ... a_N of length N and a string b = b_1 b_2 ... b_M of length M, we say a < b for the lexicographic order if either one of the following two conditions holds true:
N < M and a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_N = b_N.
There exists i (1 ≦ i ≦ N, M) such that a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_{i - 1} = b_{i - 1} and a_i < b_i. Here, letters are compared using alphabetical order.
For example, xy < xya and atcoder < atlas.

Constraints
The lengths of s and t are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
s and t consists of lowercase English letters.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s
t

Output
If it is possible to satisfy s' < t', print Yes; if it is not, print No.

Sample Input 1
yx
axy

Sample Output 1
Yes
We can, for example, rearrange yx into xy and axy into yxa. Then, xy < yxa.

Sample Input 2
ratcode
atlas

Sample Output 2
Yes
We can, for example, rearrange ratcode into acdeort and atlas into tslaa. Then, acdeort < tslaa.

Sample Input 3
cd
abc

Sample Output 3
No
No matter how we rearrange cd and abc, we cannot achieve our objective.

Sample Input 4
w
ww

Sample Output 4
Yes

Sample Input 5
zzz
zzz

Sample Output 5
No
