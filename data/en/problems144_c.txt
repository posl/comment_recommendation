Problem Statement
Takahashi is standing on a multiplication table with infinitely many rows and columns.
The square (i,j) contains the integer i times j. Initially, Takahashi is standing at (1,1).
In one move, he can move from (i,j) to either (i+1,j) or (i,j+1).
Given an integer N, find the minimum number of moves needed to reach a square that contains N.

Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}
N is an integer.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the minimum number of moves needed to reach a square that contains the integer N.

Sample Input 1
10

Sample Output 1
5
(2,5) can be reached in five moves. We cannot reach a square that contains 10 in less than five moves.

Sample Input 2
50

Sample Output 2
13
(5, 10) can be reached in 13 moves.

Sample Input 3
10000000019

Sample Output 3
10000000018
Both input and output may be enormous.
