Problem Statement
We have a sequence of length N: A=(a_1,ldots,a_N). Additionally, you are given an integer K.
You can perform the following operation zero or more times.
Choose an integer i such that 1 ≦ i ≦ N-K, then swap the values of a_i and a_{i+K}.
Determine whether it is possible to sort A in ascending order.

Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 2 times 10^5
1 ≦ K ≦ N-1
1 ≦ a_i ≦ 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
a_1 ldots a_N

Output
If it is possible to sort A in ascending order, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
5 2
3 4 1 3 4

Sample Output 1
Yes
The following sequence of operations sorts A in ascending order.
Choose i=1 to swap the values of a_1 and a_3. A is now (1,4,3,3,4).
Choose i=2 to swap the values of a_2 and a_4. A is now (1,3,3,4,4).

Sample Input 2
5 3
3 4 1 3 4

Sample Output 2
No

Sample Input 3
7 5
1 2 3 4 5 5 10

Sample Output 3
Yes
No operations may be needed.
