Problem Statement
You are given an integer sequence of length N: A=(A_1,A_2,ldots,A_N).
You will perform the following consecutive operations just once:
Choose an integer x (0≦ x ≦ N). If x is 0, do nothing. If x is 1 or greater, replace each of A_1,A_2,ldots,A_x with L.
Choose an integer y (0≦ y ≦ N). If y is 0, do nothing. If y is 1 or greater, replace each of A_{N},A_{N-1},ldots,A_{N-y+1} with R.
Print the minimum possible sum of the elements of A after the operations.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2times 10^5
-10^9 ≦ L, R≦ 10^9
-10^9 ≦ A_i≦ 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N L R
A_1 A_2 ldots A_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
5 4 3
5 5 0 6 3

Sample Output 1
14
If you choose x=2 and y=2, you will get A = (4,4,0,3,3), for the sum of 14, which is the minimum sum achievable.

Sample Input 2
4 10 10
1 2 3 4

Sample Output 2
10
If you choose x=0 and y=0, you will get A = (1,2,3,4), for the sum of 10, which is the minimum sum achievable.

Sample Input 3
10 -5 -3
9 -6 10 -1 2 10 -1 7 -15 5

Sample Output 3
-58
L, R, and A_i may be negative.
