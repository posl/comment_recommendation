Problem Statement
We have a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1 through N, and the edges are numbered 1 through M.
Edge i connects Vertex A_i and Vertex B_i.
Find the number of ways to paint each vertex in this graph red, green, or blue so that the following condition is satisfied:
two vertices directly connected by an edge are always painted in different colors.
Here, it is not mandatory to use all the colors.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 20
0 ≦ M ≦ ((N(N - 1))/(2))
1 ≦ A_i ≦ N
1 ≦ B_i ≦ N
The given graph is simple (that is, has no multi-edges and no self-loops).

Let c_1, c_2, c_3 be the colors of Vertices 1, 2, 3 and R, G, B denote red, green, blue, respectively. There are six ways to satisfy the condition:
c_1c_2c_3 =  RGB
c_1c_2c_3 =  RBG
c_1c_2c_3 =  GRB
c_1c_2c_3 =  GBR
c_1c_2c_3 =  BRG
c_1c_2c_3 =  BGR

Sample Input 2
3 0

Sample Output 2
27
Since the graph has no edge, we can freely choose the colors of the vertices.
