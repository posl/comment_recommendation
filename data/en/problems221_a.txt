Problem Statement
The magnitude of an earthquake is a logarithmic scale of the energy released by the earthquake. It is known that each time the magnitude increases by 1, the amount of energy gets multiplied by approximately 32.
Here, we assume that the amount of energy gets multiplied by exactly 32 each time the magnitude increases by 1. In this case, how many times is the amount of energy of a magnitude A earthquake as much as that of a magnitude B earthquake?

Constraints
3≦ B≦ A≦ 9
A and B are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
6 4

Sample Output 1
1024
6 is 2 greater than 4, so a magnitude 6 earthquake has 32times 32=1024 times as much energy as a magnitude 4 earthquake has.

Sample Input 2
5 5

Sample Output 2
1
Earthquakes with the same magnitude have the same amount of energy.
