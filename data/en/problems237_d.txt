Problem Statement
There is a sequence that contains one 0, A=(0).
Additionally, you are given a string of length N, S=s_1s_2... s_N, consisting of L and R.
For each i=1, 2, ..., N in this order, the following will be done.
If s_i is L, insert i to the immediate left of i-1 in A.
If s_i is R, insert i to the immediate right of i-1 in A.
Find the final contents of A.

Constraints
1≦ N ≦ 5× 10^5
N is an integer.
|S| = N
s_i is L or R.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

Output
Print the final contents of A, separated by spaces.

Sample Input 1
5
LRRLR

Sample Output 1
1 2 4 5 3 0
Initially, A=(0).
S_1 is L, which makes it A=(1,0).
S_2 is R, which makes it A=(1,2,0).
S_3 is R, which makes it A=(1,2,3,0).
S_4 is L, which makes it A=(1,2,4,3,0).
S_5 is R, which makes it A=(1,2,4,5,3,0).  

Sample Input 2
7
LLLLLLL

Sample Output 2
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
