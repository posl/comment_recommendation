Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of N integers: A=(A _ 1,A _ 2,...,A _ N).
Print all even numbers in A without changing the order.

Constraints
1≦ N≦ 100
1≦ A _ i≦ 100 (1≦ i≦ N)
A contains at least one even number.
All values in the input are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A _ 1 A _ 2 ... A _ N

Output
Print a line containing the sequence of all even numbers in A, with spaces in between.

Sample Input 1
5
1 2 3 5 6

Sample Output 1
2 6
We have A=(1,2,3,5,6).
Among them are two even numbers, A _ 2=2 and A _ 5=6, so print 2 and 6 in this order, with a space in between.

Sample Input 2
5
2 2 2 3 3

Sample Output 2
2 2 2
A may contain equal elements.

Sample Input 3
10
22 3 17 8 30 15 12 14 11 17

Sample Output 3
22 8 30 12 14
