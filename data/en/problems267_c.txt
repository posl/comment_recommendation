Problem Statement
You are given an integer sequence A=(A_1,A_2,...,A_N) of length N.
Find the maximum value of  sum_{i=1}^{M} i × B_i for a contiguous subarray B=(B_1,B_2,...,B_M) of A of length M.

Notes
A contiguous subarray of a number sequence is a sequence that is obtained by removing 0 or more initial terms and 0 or more final terms from the original number sequence.
For example, (2, 3) and (1, 2, 3) are contiguous subarrays of (1, 2, 3, 4), but (1, 3) and (3,2,1) are not contiguous subarrays of (1, 2, 3, 4).  

Constraints
1 ≦ M ≦ N ≦ 2 × 10^5
- 2 × 10^5 ≦ A_i ≦ 2 × 10^5
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
4 2
5 4 -1 8

Sample Output 1
15
When B=(A_3,A_4), we have  sum_{i=1}^{M} i × B_i = 1 × (-1) + 2 × 8 = 15.  Since it is impossible to achieve 16 or a larger value, the solution is 15.
Note that you are not allowed to choose, for instance, B=(A_1,A_4).

Sample Input 2
10 4
-3 1 -4 1 -5 9 -2 6 -5 3

Sample Output 2
31
