Problem Statement
You are given an integer sequence of length n, a_1, ..., a_n.
Let us consider performing the following n operations on an empty sequence b.
The i-th operation is as follows:
Append a_i to the end of b.
Reverse the order of the elements in b.
Find the sequence b obtained after these n operations.

Constraints
1 ≦ n ≦ 2× 10^5
0 ≦ a_i ≦ 10^9
n and a_i are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n
a_1 a_2 ... a_n

Output
Print n integers in a line with spaces in between.
The i-th integer should be b_i.

Sample Input 1
4
1 2 3 4

Sample Output 1
4 2 1 3
After step 1 of the first operation, b becomes: 1.
After step 2 of the first operation, b becomes: 1.
After step 1 of the second operation, b becomes: 1, 2.
After step 2 of the second operation, b becomes: 2, 1.
After step 1 of the third operation, b becomes: 2, 1, 3.
After step 2 of the third operation, b becomes: 3, 1, 2.
After step 1 of the fourth operation, b becomes: 3, 1, 2, 4.
After step 2 of the fourth operation, b becomes: 4, 2, 1, 3.
Thus, the answer is 4 2 1 3.

Sample Input 2
3
1 2 3

Sample Output 2
3 1 2
As shown above in Sample Output 1
, b becomes 3, 1, 2 after step 2 of the third operation. Thus, the answer is 3 1 2.
