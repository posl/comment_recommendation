Problem Statement
There are N cities. The time it takes to travel from City i to City j is T_{i, j}.
Among those paths that start at City 1, visit all other cities exactly once, and then go back to City 1, how many paths take the total time of exactly K to travel along?

Constraints
2≦ N ≦ 8
If ineq j, 1≦ T_{i,j} ≦ 10^8.
T_{i,i}=0
T_{i,j}=T_{j,i}
1≦ K ≦ 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
T_{1,1} ldots T_{1,N}
vdots
T_{N,1} ldots T_{N,N}

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
4 330
0 1 10 100
1 0 20 200
10 20 0 300
100 200 300 0

Sample Output 1
2
There are six paths that start at City 1, visit all other cities exactly once, and then go back to City 1:
1to 2to 3to 4to 1
1to 2to 4to 3to 1
1to 3to 2to 4to 1
1to 3to 4to 2to 1
1to 4to 2to 3to 1
1to 4to 3to 2to 1
The times it takes to travel along these paths are 421, 511, 330, 511, 330, and 421, respectively, among which two are exactly 330.

Sample Input 2
5 5
0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0

Sample Output 2
24
In whatever order we visit the cities, it will take the total time of 5 to travel.
