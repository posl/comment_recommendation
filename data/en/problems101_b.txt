Problem Statement
Let S(n) denote the sum of the digits in the decimal notation of n.
For example, S(101) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
Given an integer N, determine if S(N) divides N.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^9

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
If S(N) divides N, print Yes; if it does not, print No.

Sample Input 1
12

Sample Output 1
Yes
In this input, N=12.
As S(12) = 1 + 2 = 3, S(N) divides N.

Sample Input 2
101

Sample Output 2
No
As S(101) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, S(N) does not divide N.

Sample Input 3
999999999

Sample Output 3
Yes
