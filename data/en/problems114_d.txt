Problem Statement
You are given an integer N. Among the divisors of N! (= 1 times 2 times ... times N), how many Shichi-Go numbers (literally "Seven-Five numbers") are there?
Here, a Shichi-Go number is a positive integer that has exactly 75 divisors.

NoteWhen a positive integer A divides a positive integer B, A is said to a divisor of B.
For example, 6 has four divisors: 1, 2, 3 and 6.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 100
N is an integer.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the number of the Shichi-Go numbers that are divisors of N!.

Sample Input 1
9

Sample Output 1
0
There are no Shichi-Go numbers among the divisors of 9! = 1 times 2 times ... times 9 = 362880.

Sample Input 2
10

Sample Output 2
1
There is one Shichi-Go number among the divisors of 10! = 3628800: 32400.

Sample Input 3
100

Sample Output 3
543
