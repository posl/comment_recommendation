Problem Statement
From the point (0,0) in a two-dimensional plane, let us move the distance of 1 toward the point (A, B). Find our coordinates after the move.
Here, after moving the distance of d from a point X to a point Y (d le length of the segment XY), we are at the point on the segment XY whose distance from X is d.
The Constraints
 guarantee that the distance between the points (0, 0) and (A, B) is at least 1.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
0 le A,B le 1000
(A,B) neq (0,0)

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output
Let (x, y) be our coordinates after the move. Print x and y in this order, separated by a space.
Your output is considered correct when, for each printed value, the absolute or relative error from the judge's answer is at most 10^{âˆ’6}.

Sample Input 1
3 4

Sample Output 1
0.600000000000 0.800000000000
Printing 0.5999999999 0.8000000001, for example, would also be accepted.

Sample Input 2
1 0

Sample Output 2
1.000000000000 0.000000000000
We may arrive at (A, B).

Sample Input 3
246 402

Sample Output 3
0.521964870245 0.852966983083
