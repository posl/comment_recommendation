Problem Statement
There are N islands and M bridges.
The i-th bridge connects the A_i-th and B_i-th islands bidirectionally.
Initially, we can travel between any two islands using some of these bridges.
However, the results of a survey show that these bridges will all collapse because of aging, in the order from the first bridge to the M-th bridge.
Let the inconvenience be the number of pairs of islands (a, b) (a < b) such that we are no longer able to travel between the a-th and b-th islands using some of the bridges remaining.
For each i (1 ≦ i ≦ M), find the inconvenience just after the i-th bridge collapses.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
2 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ M ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ A_i < B_i ≦ N
All pairs (A_i, B_i) are distinct.
The inconvenience is initially 0.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
.

.
A_M B_M

Output
In the order i = 1, 2, ..., M, print the inconvenience just after the i-th bridge collapses.
Note that the answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer type.

For example, when the first to third bridges have collapsed, the inconvenience is 4 since we can no longer travel between the pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4) and (3, 4).
