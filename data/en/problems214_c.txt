Problem Statement
There are N creatures standing in a circle, called Snuke 1, 2, ..., N in counter-clockwise order.
When Snuke i (1 ≦ i ≦ N) receives a gem at time t, S_i units of time later, it will hand that gem to Snuke i+1 at time t+S_i. Here, Snuke N+1 is Snuke 1.
Additionally, Takahashi will hand a gem to Snuke i at time T_i.
For each i (1 ≦ i ≦ N), find the time when Snuke i receives a gem for the first time. Assume that it takes a negligible time to hand a gem.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 200000
1 ≦ S_i,T_i ≦ 10^9
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1 S_2 ldots S_N
T_1 T_2 ldots T_N

Output
Print N lines. The i-th line (1 ≦ i ≦ N) should contain the time when Snuke i receives a gem for the first time.

We will list the three Snuke's and Takahashi's actions up to time 13 in chronological order.
Time 3: Takahashi hands a gem to Snuke 1.
Time 7: Snuke 1 hands a gem to Snuke 2.
Time 8: Snuke 2 hands a gem to Snuke 3.
Time 10: Takahashi hands a gem to Snuke 2.
Time 11: Snuke 2 hands a gem to Snuke 3.
Time 13: Snuke 3 hands a gem to Snuke 1.
After that, they will continue handing gems, though it will be irrelevant to the answer.

Note that a Snuke may perform multiple transactions simultaneously. Particularly, a Snuke may receive gems simultaneously from Takahashi and another Snuke.
