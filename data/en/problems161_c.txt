Problem Statement
Given any integer x, Aoki can do the operation below.
Operation: Replace x with the absolute difference of x and K.
You are given the initial value of an integer N. Find the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times.

Constraints
0 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18}
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{18}
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K

Output
Print the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times.

Sample Input 1
7 4

Sample Output 1
1
Initially, N=7.
After one operation, N becomes |7-4| = 3.
After two operations, N becomes |3-4| = 1, which is the minimum value taken by N.

Sample Input 2
2 6

Sample Output 2
2
N=2 after zero operations is the minimum.

Sample Input 3
1000000000000000000 1

Sample Output 3
0
