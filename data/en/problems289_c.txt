Problem Statement
There are M sets, called S_1, S_2, dots, S_M, consisting of integers between 1 and N.
S_i consists of C_i integers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, dots, a_{i, C_i}.
There are (2^M-1) ways to choose one or more sets from the M sets.
How many of them satisfy the following condition?
For all integers x such that 1 ≦ x ≦ N, there is at least one chosen set containing x.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10
1 ≦ M ≦ 10
1 ≦ C_i ≦ N
1 ≦ a_{i,1} < a_{i,2} < dots < a_{i,C_i} ≦ N
All values in the input are integers.

Input

The sets given in the input are S_1 = lbrace 1, 2 rbrace, S_2 = lbrace 1, 3 rbrace, S_3 = lbrace 2 rbrace.
The following three ways satisfy the conditions in the Problem Statement
:
choosing S_1, S_2;
choosing S_1, S_2, S_3;
choosing S_2, S_3.
