Problem Statement
One day, Takahashi got up at exactly B minutes past A o'clock (in 24-hour clock), and Aoki got up at exactly D minutes and 1 second past C o'clock.
If Takahashi got up earlier than Aoki, print Takahashi; otherwise, print Aoki.

Constraints
0 ≦ A ≦ 23
0 ≦ B ≦ 59
0 ≦ C ≦ 23
0 ≦ D ≦ 59
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C D

Output
If Takahashi got up earlier than Aoki, print Takahashi; otherwise, print Aoki.

Sample Input 1
7 0 6 30

Sample Output 1
Aoki
Takahashi got up at 7 sharp, and Aoki got up at 30 minutes and 1 second past 6 o'clock.
Aoki was the first to get up, so Aoki should be printed.

Sample Input 2
7 30 7 30

Sample Output 2
Takahashi
Takahashi got up at exactly half past 7, and Aoki got up at 30 minutes and 1 second past 7 o'clock.
Just by one second, Takahashi was the first to get up, so Takahashi should be printed.

Sample Input 3
0 0 23 59

Sample Output 3
Takahashi
0:00 in a day is one minute before 0:01, not one minute past 23:59 ("24:00").
Thus, Takahashi was the first to get up, so Takahashi should be printed.
