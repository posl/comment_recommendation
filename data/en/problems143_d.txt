Problem Statement
Takahashi has N sticks that are distinguishable from each other. The length of the i-th stick is L_i.
He is going to form a triangle using three of these sticks. Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the three sticks used. Here, all of the following conditions must be satisfied:
a < b + c
b < c + a
c < a + b
How many different triangles can be formed? Two triangles are considered different when there is a stick used in only one of them.
