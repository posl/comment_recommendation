All of a, b, and c are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b c

Output
If there are two same numbers among a, b, and c, print the remaining number. Otherwise, print 0.

Sample Input 1
2 5 2

Sample Output 1
5
The first and third dice both showed 2, so we should print the number on the remaining dice, which is 5.

Sample Input 2
4 5 6

Sample Output 2
0
Any two numbers are different, so we should print 0.

Sample Input 3
1 1 1
