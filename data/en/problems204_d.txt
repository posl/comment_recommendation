Problem Statement
Takahashi is going to cook N dishes called Dish 1 through N.
Dish i can be cooked by using an oven for T_i consecutive minutes. An oven cannot be used for two or more dishes simultaneously.
If Takahashi has two ovens to use, what is the shortest number of minutes needed to cook all the N dishes? Assume that all processes other than using ovens take negligible time.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ T_i ≦ 10^3
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
T_1 ... T_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
5
8 3 7 2 5

Sample Output 1
13
We can, for example, use the two ovens as follows to cook all the dishes in 13 minutes.
The first oven: Cook Dishes 5 and 1 in this order.
The second oven: Cook Dishes 2, 4, and 3 in this order.
