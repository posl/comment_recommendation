The date may change while the light is on.
Determine whether the light is on at 30 minutes past X o'clock.

Constraints
0 ≦ S, T, X ≦ 23
S ≠ T
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output
If the light is on at 30 minutes past X o'clock, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
