Problem Statement
Alice and Bob are controlling a robot. They each have one switch that controls the robot.
Alice started holding down her button A second after the start-up of the robot, and released her button B second after the start-up.
Bob started holding down his button C second after the start-up, and released his button D second after the start-up.
For how many seconds both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons?

Constraints
0≤A<B≤100
0≤C<D≤100
All input values are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:  
A B C D

Output
Print the length of the duration (in seconds) in which both Alice and Bob were holding down their buttons.

Sample Input 1
0 75 25 100

Sample Output 1
50
Alice started holding down her button 0 second after the start-up of the robot, and released her button 75 second after the start-up.
Bob started holding down his button 25 second after the start-up, and released his button 100 second after the start-up.
Therefore, the time when both of them were holding down their buttons, is the 50 seconds from 25 seconds after the start-up to 75 seconds after the start-up.

Sample Input 2
0 33 66 99

Sample Output 2
0
Alice and Bob were not holding their buttons at the same time, so the answer is zero seconds.

Sample Input 3
10 90 20 80

Sample Output 3
60
