Problem Statement
You are given two strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters.
Determine if S is a prefix of T.
What is a prefix?
A prefix of a string T_1T_2ldots T_N of length N is a string expressed as the first i characters of T, T_1T_2ldots T_i, where i is an integer such that 0 ≦ i ≦ N.  For example, when T =  abc, there are four prefixes of T: an empty string, a, ab, and abc.
