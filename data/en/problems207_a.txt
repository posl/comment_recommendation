There are three cards on the desk, each with a positive integer written on it. The integers on the cards are A, B, and C.
You have chosen two cards and picked them up.
Find the maximum possible sum of the integers written on the picked cards.

Constraints
1 ≦ A,B,C ≦ 100
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B C

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
3 4 5

Sample Output 1
9
If you pick up two cards with 4 and 5, the sum of the integers will be 4+5=9.
There is no way to pick up cards with a greater sum, so we should print 9.

Sample Input 2
6 6 6

Sample Output 2
12
Whichever two cards you choose, the sum of the integers will be 12.

Sample Input 3
99 99 98

Sample Output 3
