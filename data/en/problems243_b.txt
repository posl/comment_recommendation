Problem Statement
You are given integer sequences, each of length N: A = (A_1, A_2, dots, A_N) and B = (B_1, B_2, dots, B_N).
All elements of A are different. All elements of B are different, too.
Print the following two values.
The number of integers contained in both A and B, appearing at the same position in the two sequences. In other words, the number of integers i such that A_i = B_i.
The number of integers contained in both A and B, appearing at different positions in the two sequences. In other words, the number of pairs of integers (i, j) such that A_i = B_j and i neq j.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 1000
1 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9
1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9
A_1, A_2, dots, A_N are all different.
B_1, B_2, dots, B_N are all different.
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 dots A_N
B_1 B_2 dots B_N

Output
Print the answers in two lines: the answer to1. in the first line, and the answer to2. in the second line.
