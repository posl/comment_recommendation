Problem Statement
You are given integers A and B between 0 and 255 (inclusive). Find a non-negative integer C such that A text{ xor }C=B.
It can be proved that there uniquely exists such C, and it will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive).
What is bitwise mathrm{XOR}?
The bitwise mathrm{XOR} of integers A and B, A mathrm{XOR} B, is defined as follows:
        
When A mathrm{XOR} B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k geq 0) is 1 if exactly one of A and B is 1, and 0 otherwise.
        For example, we have 3 mathrm{XOR} 5 = 6 (in base two: 011 mathrm{XOR} 101 = 110).


Constraints
0≦ A,B ≦ 255
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
3 6

Sample Output 1
5
When written in binary, 3 will be 11, and 5 will be 101. Thus, their text{xor} will be 110 in binary, or 6 in decimal.
In short, 3 text{ xor } 5 = 6, so the answer is 5.

Sample Input 2
10 12

Sample Output 2
6
