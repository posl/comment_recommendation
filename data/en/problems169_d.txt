Problem Statement
Given is a positive integer N. Consider repeatedly applying the operation below on N:
First, choose a positive integer z satisfying all of the conditions below:
z can be represented as z=p^e, where p is a prime number and e is a positive integer;
z divides N;
z is different from all integers chosen in previous operations.
Then, replace N with N/z.
Find the maximum number of times the operation can be applied.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^{12}

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the maximum number of times the operation can be applied.

Sample Input 1
24

Sample Output 1
3
We can apply the operation three times by, for example, making the following choices:
Choose z=2 (=2^1). (Now we have N=12.)
Choose z=3 (=3^1). (Now we have N=4.)
Choose z=4 (=2^2). (Now we have N=1.)

Sample Input 2
1

Sample Output 2
0
We cannot apply the operation at all.

Sample Input 3
64

Sample Output 3
3
We can apply the operation three times by, for example, making the following choices:
Choose z=2 (=2^1). (Now we have N=32.)
Choose z=4 (=2^2). (Now we have N=8.)
Choose z=8 (=2^3). (Now we have N=1.)

Sample Input 4
1000000007

Sample Output 4
1
We can apply the operation once by, for example, making the following choice:
z=1000000007 (=1000000007^1). (Now we have N=1.)

Sample Input 5
997764507000

Sample Output 5
7
