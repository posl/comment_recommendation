Problem Statement
You are given a string S. Find the lexicographically smallest string S' obtained by permuting the characters of S.
Here, for different two strings s = s_1 s_2 ... s_n and t = t_1 t_2 ... t_m, s < t holds lexicographically when one of the conditions below is satisfied.
There is an integer i (1 ≦ i ≦ min(n,m)) such that s_i < t_i and s_j=t_j for all integers j (1 ≦ j < i).
s_i = t_i for all integers i (1 ≦ i ≦ min(n,m)), and n < m.

Constraints
S is a string of length between 1 and 2 × 10^5 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output
Print the lexicographically smallest string S' obtained by permuting the characters in S.

Sample Input 1
aba

Sample Output 1
aab
Three strings can be obtained by permuting aba:
aba
aab
baa
The lexicographically smallest among them is aab.
