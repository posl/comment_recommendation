Problem Statement
Takahashi is taking exams on N subjects. The score on each subject will be an integer between 0 and K (inclusive).
He has already taken exams on N-1 subjects and scored A_i points on the i-th subject.
His goal is to achieve the average score of M points or above on the N subjects.
Print the minimum number of points Takahashi needs on the final subject to achieve his goal.
If the goal is unachievable, print -1 instead.

Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ K ≦ 100
1 ≦ M ≦ K
0 ≦ A_i ≦ K

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
