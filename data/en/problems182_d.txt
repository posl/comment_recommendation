Problem Statement
Given is a number sequence A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_N, which may contain negative elements.
On a number line, there is a robot at coordinate 0. It will do the following actions in order:  
Move A_1 in the positive direction.
Move A_1 in the positive direction, and then move A_2 in the positive direction.
Move A_1 in the positive direction, then move A_2 in the positive direction, and then move A_3 in the positive direction.

Move A_1 in the positive direction, then move A_2 in the positive direction, then move A_3 in the positive direction, ..., ..., and then move A_N in the positive direction.
Find the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot from the beginning to the end of the process.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 200000
-10^8 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^8
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 A_3 ... A_N

Output
Print the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot from the beginning to the end of the process.

Sample Input 1
3
2 -1 -2

Sample Output 1
5
The robot moves as follows:
Move 2 in the positive direction, to coordinate 2.
Move 2 in the positive direction, to coordinate 4. Then move -1 in the positive direction, to coordinate 3.
Move 2 in the positive direction, to coordinate 5. Then move -1 in the positive direction, to coordinate 4. Then move -2 in the positive direction, to coordinate 2.
The greatest coordinate occupied during the process is 5, so we should print 5.

Sample Input 2
5
-2 1 3 -1 -1

Sample Output 2
2

Sample Input 3
5
-1000 -1000 -1000 -1000 -1000

Sample Output 3
0
In this case, the initial coordinate 0 is the greatest coordinate occupied.
