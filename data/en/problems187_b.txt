Problem Statement
On the xy-plane, We have N points numbered 1 to N. Point i is at (x_i, y_i), and the x-coordinates of the N points are pairwise different.
Find the number of pairs of integers (i, j) (i < j) that satisfy the following condition:
The line passing through Point i and Point j has a slope between -1 and 1 (inclusive).

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 le N le 10^3
|x_i|, |y_i| le 10^3
x_i neq x_j for i neq j.
