Problem Statement
Given is an integer N. How many integers between 1 and N (inclusive) are unrepresentable as a^b, where a and b are integers not less than 2?

Constraints
N is an integer.
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{10}

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
8

Sample Output 1
6
4 and 8 are representable as a^b: we have 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8.
On the other hand, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are unrepresentable as a^b using integers a and b not less than 2, so the answer is 6.

Sample Input 2
100000

Sample Output 2
99634
