Problem Statement
How many integer sequences A_1,A_2,...,A_N of length N satisfy all of the following conditions?
0 ≦ A_i ≦ 9
There exists some i such that A_i=0 holds.
There exists some i such that A_i=9 holds.
The answer can be very large, so output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^6
N is an integer.
