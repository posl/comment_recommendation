Problem Statement
E869120 has A 1-yen coins and infinitely many 500-yen coins.
Determine if he can pay exactly N yen using only these coins.

Constraints
N is an integer between 1 and 10000 (inclusive).
A is an integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A

Output
If E869120 can pay exactly N yen using only his 1-yen and 500-yen coins, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
2018
218

Sample Output 1
Yes
We can pay 2018 yen with four 500-yen coins and 18 1-yen coins, so the answer is Yes.

Sample Input 2
2763
0

Sample Output 2
No
When we have no 1-yen coins, we can only pay a multiple of 500 yen using only 500-yen coins. Since 2763 is not a multiple of 500, we cannot pay this amount.

Sample Input 3
37
514

Sample Output 3
Yes
