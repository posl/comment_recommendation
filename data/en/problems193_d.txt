Problem Statement
We have 9K cards. For each i = 1, 2, dots, 9, there are K cards with i written on it.
We randomly shuffled these cards and handed out five cards - four face up and one face down - to each of Takahashi and Aoki.
You are given a string S representing the cards handed out to Takahashi and a string T representing the cards handed out to Aoki.
S and T are strings of five characters each. Each of the first four characters of each string is 1, 2, dots, or 9, representing the number written on the face-up card. The last character of each string is #, representing that the card is face down.
Let us define the score of a five-card hand as displaystyle sum_{i=1}^9 i times 10^{c_i}, where c_i is the number of cards with i written on them.
Takahashi wins when the score of Takahashi's hand is higher than that of Aoki's hand.
Find the probability that Takahashi wins.

Constraints
2 ≤ K ≤ 10^5
|S| = |T| = 5
The first through fourth characters of each of S and T are 1, 2, dots, or 9.
Each of the digit 1, 2, dots, and 9 appears at most K times in total in S and T.
The fifth character of each of S and T is #.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K
S
T

Output
Print the probability that Takahashi wins, as a decimal.
Your answer will be judged as correct when its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-5}.

Sample Input 1
2
1144#
2233#

Sample Output 1
0.4444444444444444
For example, if Takahashi's hand is 11449 and Aoki's hand is 22338, Takahashi's score is 100+2+3+400+5+6+7+8+90=621 and Aoki's score is 1+200+300+4+5+6+7+80+9=612, resulting in Takahashi's win.
Takahashi wins when the number on his face-down card is greater than that of Aoki's face-down card, so Takahashi will win with probability frac49.

1.0

Sample Input 3

1122#
2228#

Sample Output 3
0.001932367149758454
Takahashi wins only when Takahashi's hand is 11222 and Aoki's hand is 22281, with probability frac2{1035}.
