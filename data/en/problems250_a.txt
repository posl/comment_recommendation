Problem Statement
There is a grid with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
Find the number of squares that share a side with Square (R, C).
Here, two squares (a,b) and (c,d) are said to share a side if and only if |a-c|+|b-d|=1 (where |x| denotes the absolute value of x).

Constraints
