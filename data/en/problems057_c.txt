Problem Statement
You are given an integer N.
For two positive integers A and B, we will define F(A,B) as the larger of the following: the number of digits in the decimal notation of A, and the number of digits in the decimal notation of B.
For example, F(3,11) = 2 since 3 has one digit and 11 has two digits.
Find the minimum value of F(A,B) as (A,B) ranges over all pairs of positive integers such that N = A × B.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^{10}
N is an integer.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the minimum value of F(A,B) as (A,B) ranges over all pairs of positive integers such that N = A × B.

Sample Input 1
10000

Sample Output 1
3
F(A,B) has a minimum value of 3 at (A,B)=(100,100).

Sample Input 2
1000003

Sample Output 2
7
There are two pairs (A,B) that satisfy the condition: (1,1000003) and (1000003,1). For these pairs, F(1,1000003)=F(1000003,1)=7.

Sample Input 3
9876543210

Sample Output 3
