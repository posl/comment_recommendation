Problem Statement
We have a grid with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns.  (i, j) denotes the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.
(i,j) has a character G_{i,j} written on it.  G_{i,j} is U, D, L, or R.
You are initially at (1,1).  You repeat the following operation until you cannot make a move.
Let (i,j) be the square you are currently at.
If G_{i,j} is U and i ≠ 1, move to (i-1,j).
If G_{i,j} is D and i ≠ H, move to (i+1,j).
If G_{i,j} is L and j ≠ 1, move to (i,j-1).
If G_{i,j} is R and j ≠ W, move to (i,j+1).
Otherwise, you cannot make a move.  
Print the square you end up at when you cannot make a move.
If you indefinitely repeat moving, print -1 instead.

Constraints
1 ≦ H, W ≦ 500
G_{i,j} is U, D, L, or R.
H and W are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
G_{1,1}G_{1,2}... G_{1,W}
G_{2,1}G_{2,2}... G_{2,W}
.
.
.
G_{H,1}G_{H,2}... G_{H,W}

Output
If you end up at (i, j), print it in the following format:
i j
If you indefinitely repeat moving, print -1.

Sample Input 1
2 3
RDU
LRU

Sample Output 1
1 3
You will move as (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3), ending up here, so the answer is (1, 3).

Sample Input 2
2 3
RRD
ULL

Sample Output 2
-1
You will indefinitely repeat moving as (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> ..., so -1 should be printed in this case.
