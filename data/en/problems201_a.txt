Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of three numbers: A=(A_1,A_2,A_3).
Is it possible to rearrange the elements of A into an arithmetic sequence?
In other words, is it possible to rearrange the elements of A so that A_3-A_2=A_2-A_1?

Constrains
1 ≦ A_i ≦ 100
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A_1 A_2 A_3

Output
If it is possible to rearrange the elements of A into an arithmetic sequence, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
5 1 3

Sample Output 1
Yes
We can rearrange them into an arithmetic sequence by, for example, making it (1,3,5).

Sample Input 2
1 4 3

Sample Output 2
No
There is no way to rearrange them into an arithmetic sequence.

Sample Input 3
5 5 5

Sample Output 3
Yes
All elements of A may be equal, or A may be an arithmetic sequence already.
