Problem Statement
Takahashi went to an all-you-can-eat buffet with N kinds of dishes and ate all of them (Dish 1, Dish 2, ldots, Dish N) once.
The i-th dish (1 ≦ i ≦ N) he ate was Dish A_i.
When he eats Dish i (1 ≦ i ≦ N), he gains B_i satisfaction points.
Additionally, when he eats Dish i+1 just after eating Dish i (1 ≦ i ≦ N - 1), he gains C_i more satisfaction points.
Find the sum of the satisfaction points he gained.

Constraints
