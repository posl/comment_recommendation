Problem Statement
We have a grid with H rows and W columns. The square at the i-th row and the j-th column will be called Square (i,j).
The integers from 1 through H×W are written throughout the grid, and the integer written in Square (i,j) is A_{i,j}.
You, a magical girl, can teleport a piece placed on Square (i,j) to Square (x,y) by consuming |x-i|+|y-j| magic points.
You now have to take Q practical tests of your ability as a magical girl.
The i-th test will be conducted as follows:
Initially, a piece is placed on the square where the integer L_i is written.
Let x be the integer written in the square occupied by the piece. Repeatedly move the piece to the square where the integer x+D is written, as long as x is not R_i. The test ends when x=R_i.
Here, it is guaranteed that R_i-L_i is a multiple of D.
For each test, find the sum of magic points consumed during that test.

Constraints
1 ≦ H,W ≦ 300
1 ≦ D ≦ H×W
1 ≦ A_{i,j} ≦ H×W
A_{i,j} ≠ A_{x,y} ((i,j) ≠ (x,y))
1 ≦ Q ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ L_i ≦ R_i ≦ H×W
(R_i-L_i) is a multiple of D.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W D
A_{1,1} A_{1,2} ... A_{1,W}
:
A_{H,1} A_{H,2} ... A_{H,W}
Q
L_1 R_1
:
L_Q R_Q

Output
For each test, print the sum of magic points consumed during that test.
Output should be in the order the tests are conducted.

4 8

Sample Output 1

4 is written in Square (1,2).
6 is written in Square (3,3).
8 is written in Square (3,1).
Thus, the sum of magic points consumed during the first test is (|3-1|+|3-2|)+(|3-3|+|1-3|)=5.

Note that there may be a test where the piece is not moved at all, and there may be multiple identical tests.
