Problem Statement
Ringo loves the integer 200. Solve the problem below for him.
Given a sequence A of N positive integers, find the pair of integers (i, j) satisfying all of the following conditions:
1 le i < j le N;
A_i - A_j is a multiple of 200.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
2 le N le 2 times 10^5
1 le A_i le 10^9

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 dots A_N

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
6
123 223 123 523 200 2000

Sample Output 1
4
For example, for (i, j) = (1, 3), A_1 - A_3 = 0 is a multiple of 200.
We have four pairs satisfying the conditions: (i,j)=(1,3),(1,4),(3,4),(5,6).

Sample Input 2
5
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output 2
0
There may be no pair satisfying the conditions.

Sample Input 3
8
199 100 200 400 300 500 600 200

Sample Output 3
9
