Problem Statement
You are given N strings S_1,S_2,...,S_N consisting of lowercase English alphabets.
Consider choosing some number of strings from S_1,S_2,...,S_N.
Find the maximum number of distinct alphabets that satisfy the following condition: "the alphabet is contained in exactly K of the chosen strings."

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 15
1 ≦ K ≦ N
N and K are integers.
S_i is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English alphabets.
For each integer i such that 1 ≦ i ≦ N, S_i does not contain two or more same alphabets.
If i ≠ j, then S_i ≠ S_j.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
S_1
S_2

S_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
4 2
abi
aef
bc
acg

Sample Output 1
3
When S_1,S_3, and S_4 are chosen, a,b, and c occur in exactly two of the strings.
There is no way to choose strings so that 4 or more alphabets occur in exactly 2 of the strings, so the answer is 3.

Sample Input 2
2 2
a
b

Sample Output 2
0
You cannot choose the same string more than once.

Sample Input 3
