Problem Statement
Three people, A, B and C, are trying to communicate using transceivers.
They are standing along a number line, and the coordinates of A, B and C are a, b and c (in meters), respectively.
Two people can directly communicate when the distance between them is at most d meters.
Determine if A and C can communicate, either directly or indirectly.
Here, A and C can indirectly communicate when A and B can directly communicate and also B and C can directly communicate.

Constraints
1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 100
1 ≤ d ≤ 100
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b c d

Output
If A and C can communicate, print Yes; if they cannot, print No.

Sample Input 1
4 7 9 3

Sample Output 1
Yes
A and B can directly communicate, and also B and C can directly communicate, so we should print Yes.

Sample Input 2
100 10 1 2

Sample Output 2
No
They cannot communicate in this case.

Sample Input 3
10 10 10 1

Sample Output 3
Yes
There can be multiple people at the same position.

Sample Input 4
1 100 2 10

Sample Output 4
Yes
