Problem Statement
You are given a permutation p_1,p_2,...,p_N consisting of 1,2,..,N.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Operation: Swap two adjacent elements in the permutation.
You want to have p_i ≠ i for all 1≤i≤N.
Find the minimum required number of operations to achieve this.

Constraints
2≤N≤10^5
p_1,p_2,..,p_N is a permutation of 1,2,..,N.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
p_1 p_2 .. p_N

Output
Print the minimum required number of operations

Sample Input 1
5
1 4 3 5 2

Sample Output 1
2
Swap 1 and 4, then swap 1 and 3. p is now 4,3,1,5,2 and satisfies the condition.
This is the minimum possible number, so the answer is 2.

Sample Input 2
2
1 2

Sample Output 2
1
Swapping 1 and 2 satisfies the condition.

Sample Input 3
2
2 1

Sample Output 3
0
The condition is already satisfied initially.

Sample Input 4
9
1 2 4 9 5 8 7 3 6

Sample Output 4
3
