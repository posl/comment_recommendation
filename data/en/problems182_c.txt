Problem Statement
Given is a positive integer N, where none of the digits is 0.
Let k be the number of digits in N. We want to make a multiple of 3 by erasing at least 0 and at most k-1 digits from N and concatenating the remaining digits without changing the order.
Determine whether it is possible to make a multiple of 3 in this way. If it is possible, find the minimum number of digits that must be erased to make such a number.

Constraints
1 le N < 10^{18}
None of the digits in N is 0.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
If it is impossible to make a multiple of 3, print -1; otherwise, print the minimum number of digits that must be erased to make such a number.

Sample Input 1
35

Sample Output 1
1
By erasing the 5, we get the number 3, which is a multiple of 3. Here we erased the minimum possible number of digits - 1.

Sample Input 2
369

Sample Output 2
0
Note that we can choose to erase no digit.

Sample Input 3
6227384

Sample Output 3
1
For example, by erasing the 8, we get the number 622734, which is a multiple of 3.

Sample Input 4
11

Sample Output 4
-1
Note that we must erase at least 0 and at most k-1 digits, where k is the number of digits in N, so we cannot erase all the digits.
In this case, it is impossible to make a multiple of 3 in the way described in the problem statement, so we should print -1.
