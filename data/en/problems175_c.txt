Problem Statement
Takahashi, who lives on the number line, is now at coordinate X. He will make exactly K moves of distance D in the positive or negative direction.
More specifically, in one move, he can go from coordinate x to x + D or x - D.
He wants to make K moves so that the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be the smallest possible.
Find the minimum possible absolute value of the coordinate of the destination.

Constraints
-10^{15} ≦ X ≦ 10^{15}
1 ≦ K ≦ 10^{15}
1 ≦ D ≦ 10^{15}
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X K D

Output
Print the minimum possible absolute value of the coordinate of the destination.

Sample Input 1
6 2 4

Sample Output 1
2
Takahashi is now at coordinate 6. It is optimal to make the following moves:
Move from coordinate 6 to (6 - 4 =) 2.
Move from coordinate 2 to (2 - 4 =) -2.
Here, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 2, and we cannot make it smaller.

Sample Input 2
7 4 3

Sample Output 2
1
Takahashi is now at coordinate 7. It is optimal to make, for example, the following moves:
Move from coordinate 7 to 4.
Move from coordinate 4 to 7.
Move from coordinate 7 to 4.
Move from coordinate 4 to 1.
Here, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 1, and we cannot make it smaller.

Sample Input 3
10 1 2

Sample Output 3
8

Sample Input 4
1000000000000000 1000000000000000 1000000000000000

Sample Output 4
1000000000000000
The answer can be enormous.
