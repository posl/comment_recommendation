Problem Statement
Given is an integer N.
How many integers x between 1 and N (inclusive) satisfy the following condition?
The decimal representation (without leading zeros) of x has an even number of digits, and its first and second halves are equal as strings.

Constraints
N is an integer.
1 â‰¤ N < 10^{12}

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
33

Sample Output 1
3
Three numbers 11, 22, and 33 satisfy the condition.

Sample Input 2
1333

Sample Output 2
13
For example, the decimal representation of 1313 has four digits, and its first and second halves are both 13, so 1313 satisfies the condition.

Sample Input 3
10000000

Sample Output 3
999
