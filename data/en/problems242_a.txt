There were 1000 participants in this contest, and all of them got different ranks.
Iroha-chan, who participated in this contest, ranked X-th.
Find the probability that she gets a T-shirt.

Sample Input 1
30 500 20 103

Sample Output 1
0.042553191489
Iroha-chan ranked 103-rd.
She will get a T-shirt if she is among the 20 participants chosen uniformly at random from the 470 participants who ranked between 31-st and 500-th, which happens with probability frac{20}{470}=0.04255319dots.

Sample Input 2
50 500 100 1

Sample Output 2
1.000000000000
Iroha-chan ranked 1-st. This time, she is guaranteed to get a T-shirt.

Sample Input 3
1 2 1 1000
