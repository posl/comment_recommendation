Problem Statement
Given is a permutation P_1, ldots, P_N of 1, ldots, N.
Find the number of integers i (1 ≦ i ≦ N) that satisfy the following condition:  
For any integer j (1 ≦ j ≦ i), P_i ≦ P_j.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2 times 10^5
P_1, ldots, P_N is a permutation of 1, ldots, N.  
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
P_1 ... P_N

Output
Print the number of integers i that satisfy the condition.

Sample Input 1
5
4 2 5 1 3

Sample Output 1
3
i=1, 2, and 4 satisfy the condition, but i=3 does not - for example, P_i > P_j holds for j = 1.
Similarly, i=5 does not satisfy the condition, either. Thus, there are three integers that satisfy the condition.

Sample Input 2
4
4 3 2 1

Sample Output 2
4
All integers i (1 ≦ i ≦ N) satisfy the condition.

Sample Input 3
6
1 2 3 4 5 6

Sample Output 3
1
Only i=1 satisfies the condition.

Sample Input 4
8
5 7 4 2 6 8 1 3

Sample Output 4
4

Sample Input 51
1

Sample Output
 51
