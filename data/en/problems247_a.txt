Problem Statement
There are 4 squares lined up horizontally.
You are given a string S of length 4 consisting of 0 and 1.
If the i-th character of S is 1, there is a person in the i-th square from the left;
if the i-th character of S is 0, there is no person in the i-th square from the left.
Now, everyone will move to the next square to the right simultaneously.  By this move, the person who was originally in the rightmost square will disappear.
Determine if there will be a person in each square after the move.  Print the result as a string in the same format as S.  (See also Sample Input / Output
 for clarity.)
