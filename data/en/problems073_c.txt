Problem Statement
You are playing the following game with Joisino.
Initially, you have a blank sheet of paper.
Joisino announces a number. If that number is written on the sheet, erase the number from the sheet; if not, write the number on the sheet. This process is repeated N times.
Then, you are asked a question: How many numbers are written on the sheet now?
The numbers announced by Joisino are given as A_1, ... ,A_N in the order she announces them. How many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game?

Constraints
1≤N≤100000
1≤A_i≤1000000000(=10^9)
All input values are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1
:
A_N

Output
Print how many numbers will be written on the sheet at the end of the game.

Sample Input 1
3
6
2
6

Sample Output 1
1
The game proceeds as follows:
6 is not written on the sheet, so write 6.
2 is not written on the sheet, so write 2.
6 is written on the sheet, so erase 6.
Thus, the sheet contains only 2 in the end. The answer is 1.

Sample Input 2
4
