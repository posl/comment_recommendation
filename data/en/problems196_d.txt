Problem Statement
We have a rectangular room that is H meters long and W meters wide.
We will cover this room with A indistinguishable 2 meters times 1 meters rectangular tatami mats and B indistinguishable 1 meter times 1 meter square tatami mats.
The rectangular mats can be used in either direction: they can be 2 meters long and 1 meter wide, or 1 meter long and 2 meters wide.
How many ways are there to do this?
Here, it is guaranteed that 2A + B = HW, and two ways are distinguished if they match only after rotation, reflection, or both.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≤ H, W
HW ≤ 16
0 ≤ A, B
2A + B = HW

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
