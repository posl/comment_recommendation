Problem Statement
You are given positive integers N and M.
How many sequences a of length N consisting of positive integers satisfy a_1 × a_2 × ... × a_N = M? Find the count modulo 10^9+7.
Here, two sequences a' and a'' are considered different when there exists some i such that a_i' ≠ a_i''.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ M ≦ 10^9

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

Output
