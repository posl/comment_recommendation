Problem Statement
We have two distinct integers A and B.
Print the integer K such that |A - K| = |B - K|.
If such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
0 ≦ A, B ≦ 10^9
A and B are distinct.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output
Print the integer K satisfying the condition.
If such an integer does not exist, print IMPOSSIBLE instead.

Sample Input 1
2 16

Sample Output 1
9
|2 - 9| = 7 and |16 - 9| = 7, so 9 satisfies the condition.

Sample Input 2
0 3

Sample Output 2
IMPOSSIBLE
No integer satisfies the condition.

Sample Input 3
998244353 99824435

Sample Output 3
549034394
