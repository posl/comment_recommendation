Problem Statement
Given are three integers A_1, A_2, and A_3.
If A_1+A_2+A_3 is greater than or equal to 22, print bust; otherwise, print win.

Constraints
1 ≦ A_i ≦ 13   (i=1,2,3)
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A_1 A_2 A_3

Output
If A_1+A_2+A_3 is greater than or equal to 22, print bust; otherwise, print win.

Sample Input 1
5 7 9

Sample Output 1
win
5+7+9=21, so print win.

Sample Input 2
