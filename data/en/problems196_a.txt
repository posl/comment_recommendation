Problem Statement
Given are integers a, b, c, and d.
We will choose integers x and y such that a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ y ≤ d. Find the maximum possible value of x - y here.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
-100 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 100
-100 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 100

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b
c d

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
0 10
0 10

Sample Output 1
10
(x, y) = (10, 0) achieves the maximum value x - y = 10.

Sample Input 2
-100 -100
100 100

Sample Output 2
-200

Sample Input 3
-100 100
-100 100

Sample Output 3
200
