Problem Statement
You are given integers N and M.
Consider a sequence a of length N consisting of positive integers such that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N = M. Find the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of a_1, a_2, ..., a_N.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
N ≦ M ≦ 10^9

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

Output
Print the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_N that satisfies the condition.

Sample Input 1
3 14

Sample Output 1
2
Consider the sequence (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (2, 4, 8). Their greatest common divisor is 2, and this is the maximum value.

Sample Input 2
10 123

Sample Output 2
3

Sample Input 3
100000 1000000000
