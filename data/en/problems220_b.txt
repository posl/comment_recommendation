Problem Statement
You are given integers A and B, in base K.
Print A times B in decimal.

Notes
For base-K representation, see Wikipedia's article on Positional notation.

Constraints
2 ≦ K ≦ 10
1 ≦ A,B ≦ 10^5
A and B are in base-K representation.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K
A B

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
2
1011 10100

Sample Output 1
220
1011 in base 2 corresponds to 11 in base 10.
10100 in base 2 corresponds to 20 in base 10.
We have 11 times 20 = 220, so print 220.

Sample Input 2
7
123 456

Sample Output 2
15642
123 in base 7 corresponds to 66 in base 10.
456 in base 7 corresponds to 237 in base 10.
We have 66 times 237 = 15642, so print 15642.
