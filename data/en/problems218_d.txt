Problem Statement
We have N distinct points on a two-dimensional plane, numbered 1,2,ldots,N. Point i (1 ≦ i ≦ N) has the coordinates (x_i,y_i).
How many rectangles are there whose vertices are among the given points and whose edges are parallel to the x- or y-axis?

Constraints
4 ≦ N ≦ 2000
0 ≦ x_i, y_i ≦ 10^9
(x_i,y_i) neq (x_j,y_j) (i neq j)
All values in input are integers.

Input
