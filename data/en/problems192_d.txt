Problem Statement
Given are a string X consisting of 0 through 9, and an integer M.
Let d be the greatest digit in X.
How many different integers not greater than M can be obtained by choosing an integer n not less than d+1 and seeing X as a base-n number?

Constraints
X consists of 0 through 9.
The length of X is between 1 and 60 (inclusive).
X does not begin with a 0.
1 ≦ M ≦ 10^{18}

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X
M

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
22
10

Sample Output 1
2
The greatest digit in X is 2.
By seeing X as a base-3 number, we get 8.
By seeing X as a base-4 number, we get 10.
These two values are the only ones that we can obtain and are not greater than 10.

Sample Input 2
999
1500

Sample Output 2
3
The greatest digit in X is 9.
By seeing X as a base-10 number, we get 999.
By seeing X as a base-11 number, we get 1197.
By seeing X as a base-12 number, we get 1413.
These three values are the only ones that we can obtain and are not greater than 1500.

Sample Input 3
100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1000000000000000000

Sample Output 3
1
By seeing X as a base-2 number, we get 576460752303423488, which is the only value that we can obtain and are not greater than 1000000000000000000.
