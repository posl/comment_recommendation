Problem Statement
Bowling pins are numbered 1 through 10.  The following figure is a top view of the arrangement of the pins:
Let us call each part between two dotted lines in the figure a column.
For example, Pins 1 and 5 belong to the same column, and so do Pin 3 and 9.
When some of the pins are knocked down, a special situation called split may occur.
A placement of the pins is a split if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
Pin 1 is knocked down.
There are two different columns that satisfy both of the following conditions:
Each of the columns has one or more standing pins.
There exists a column between these columns such that all pins in the column are knocked down.

See also Sample Inputs and Outputs for examples.
Now, you are given a placement of the pins as a string S of length 10.
For i = 1, ..., 10, the i-th character of S is 0 if Pin i is knocked down, and is 1 if it is standing.
Determine if the placement of the pins represented by S is a split.

Constraints
S is a string of length 10 consisting of 0 and 1.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output
If the placement of the pins represented by S is a split, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
0101110101

Sample Output 1
Yes
In the figure below, the knocked-down pins are painted gray, and the standing pins are painted white:
Between the column containing a standing pin 5 and the column containing a standing pin 6 is a column containing Pins 3 and 9.  Since Pins 3 and 9 are both knocked down, the placement is a split.

Sample Input 2
0100101001

Sample Output 2
Yes


Sample Input 3
0000100110

Sample Output 3
No
This placement is not a split.

Sample Input 4
1101110101

Sample Output 4
No
This is not a split because Pin 1 is not knocked down.
