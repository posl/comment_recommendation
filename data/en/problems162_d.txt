Problem Statement
We have a string S of length N consisting of R, G, and B.
Find the number of triples (i,~j,~k)~(1 ≦ i < j < k ≦ N) that satisfy both of the following conditions:
S_i neq S_j, S_i neq S_k, and S_j neq S_k.
j - i neq k - j.

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 4000
S is a string of length N consisting of R, G, and B.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

Output
Print the number of triplets in question.

Sample Input 1
4

Sample Output 1
1
Only the triplet (1,~3,~4) satisfies both conditions. The triplet (2,~3,~4) satisfies the first condition but not the second, so it does not count.
