Problem Statement
We have N ID cards, and there are M gates.
We can pass the i-th gate if we have one of the following ID cards: the L_i-th, (L_i+1)-th, ..., and R_i-th ID cards.
How many of the ID cards allow us to pass all the gates alone?

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ M ≦ 10^5
1 ≦ L_i ≦ R_i ≦ N

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
L_1 R_1
L_2 R_2
vdots
L_M R_M

Output
Print the number of ID cards that allow us to pass all the gates alone.

Sample Input 1
4 2
1 3
2 4

Sample Output 1
2
Two ID cards allow us to pass all the gates alone, as follows:
The first ID card does not allow us to pass the second gate.
The second ID card allows us to pass all the gates.
The third ID card allows us to pass all the gates.
The fourth ID card does not allow us to pass the first gate.
