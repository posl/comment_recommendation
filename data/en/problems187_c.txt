Problem Statement
Given are N strings S_1, S_2, dots, S_N.
Each of these is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, with zero or one ! added at the beginning.
We say a string T to be unsatisfied when it matches one of S_1, S_2, dots, S_N regardless of whether we add an ! at the beginning of T.
Determine whether there exists an unsatisfied string. If so, present one such string.

Constraints
