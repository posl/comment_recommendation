Problem Statement
There are 2000001 stones placed on a number line. The coordinates of these stones are -1000000, -999999, -999998, ldots, 999999, 1000000.
Among them, some K consecutive stones are painted black, and the others are painted white.
Additionally, we know that the stone at coordinate X is painted black.
Print all coordinates that potentially contain a stone painted black, in ascending order.

Constraints
1 ≦ K ≦ 100
0 ≦ X ≦ 100
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K X

Output
Print all coordinates that potentially contain a stone painted black, in ascending order, with spaces in between.

Sample Input 1
3 7

Sample Output 1
5 6 7 8 9
We know that there are three stones painted black, and the stone at coordinate 7 is painted black. There are three possible cases:
The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 5, 6, and 7.
The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 6, 7, and 8.
The three stones painted black are placed at coordinates 7, 8, and 9.
Thus, five coordinates potentially contain a stone painted black: 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Sample Input 2
4 0

Sample Output 2
-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3
Negative coordinates can also contain a stone painted black.

Sample Input 3
1 100

Sample Output 3
100
