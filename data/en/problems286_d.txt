Problem Statement
Takahashi has N kinds of coins;
specifically, for 1≦ i≦ N, he has B_i coins worth A_i yen (the currency in Japan) each.
Determine if Takahashi can pay exactly X yen (without change) with the coins he currently has.

Constraints
1≦ N≦ 50
1≦ X≦ 10^4
1≦ A_i≦ 100
1≦ B_i≦ 50
A_i are pairwise distinct.
All values in the input are integers.

InputThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
vdots
A_N B_N

Output
Print Yes if Takahashi can pay exactly X yen with the coins he currently has;
print No otherwise.

Sample Input 1
2 19
2 3
5 6

Sample Output 1
Yes
Takahashi has three 2-yen coins and six 5-yen coins.
He can use two 2-yen coins and three 5-yen coins to pay exactly 2times 2+5times 3=19 yen.
Thus, Yes should be printed.

Sample Input 2
2 18
2 3
5 6

Sample Output 2
No
There is no combination of the coins that he can use to pay exactly 18 yen.
Thus, No should be printed.

Sample Input 3
3 1001
1 1
2 1
100 10

Sample Output 3
Yes
He need not use all kinds of coins.
