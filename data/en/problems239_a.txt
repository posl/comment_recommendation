Problem Statement
Assuming that the horizon seen from a place x meters above the ground is sqrt{x(12800000+x)} meters away,
find how many meters away the horizon seen from a place H meters above the ground is.

Constraints
1 ≦ H ≦ 10^5
H is an integer.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H

Output
Print the answer.
Your answer will be considered correct when the absolute or relative error from the judge's answer is at most 10^{-6}.

Sample Input 1
333

Sample Output 1
65287.907678222
We have sqrt{333(12800000+333)} = 65287.9076782ldots.  Output
s such as 65287.91 would also be accepted.

Sample Input 2
634

Sample Output 2
90086.635834623
We have sqrt{634(12800000+634)} = 90086.6358346ldots.
