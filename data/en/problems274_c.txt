Problem Statement
You observed amoebae and kept some records.
Initially, there was one amoeba, numbered 1.
You made N records. According to the i-th record, the amoeba numbered A_i disappeared by dividing itself into two new amoebae, which were then numbered 2i and 2i+1.
Here, amoeba A_i is said to be the parent of amoebae 2i and 2i+1.
For each k=1,ldots,2N+1, how many generations away is amoeba k from amoeba 1?

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2times 10^5
The records are consistent. That is:
1≦ A_i ≦ 2i-1.
A_i are distinct integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ldots A_N

Output
Print 2N+1 lines. The k-th line should contain the generation distance between amoeba 1 and amoeba k.

From amoeba 1, amoebae 2 and 3 were born. From amoeba 2, amoebae 4 and 5 were born.
Amoeba 1 is zero generations away from amoeba 1.
Amoeba 2 is one generation away from amoeba 1.
Amoeba 3 is one generation away from amoeba 1.
Amoeba 4 is one generation away from amoeba 2, and two generations away from amoeba 1.
Amoeba 5 is one generation away from amoeba 2, and two generations away from amoeba 1.
