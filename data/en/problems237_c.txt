Problem Statement
Given is a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.
Determine whether adding some number of a's (possibly zero) at the beginning of S can make it a palindrome.
Here, a string of length N, A=A_1A_2ldots A_N, is said to be a palindrome when A_i=A_{N+1-i} for every 1≦ i≦ N.

Constraints
1 ≦ lvert S rvert ≦ 10^6
S consists of lowercase English letters.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output
If adding some number of a's (possibly zero) at the beginning of S can make it a palindrome, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input 1
kasaka

Sample Output 1
Yes
By adding one a at the beginning of kasaka, we have akasaka, which is a palindrome, so Yes should be printed.

Sample Input 2
atcoder

Sample Output 2
No
Adding any number of a's at the beginning of atcoder does not make it a palindrome.

Sample Input 3
php

Sample Output 3
Yes
php itself is a palindrome. Adding zero a's at the beginning of S is allowed, so Yes should be printed.
