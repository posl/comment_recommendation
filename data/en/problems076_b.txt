Problem Statement
Square1001 has seen an electric bulletin board displaying the integer 1.
He can perform the following operations A and B to change this value:
Operation A: The displayed value is doubled.
Operation B: The displayed value increases by K.
Square1001 needs to perform these operations N times in total.
Find the minimum possible value displayed in the board after N operations.

Constraints
1 ≦ N, K ≦ 10
All input values are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
K

Output
Print the minimum possible value displayed in the board after N operations.

Sample Input 1
4
3

Sample Output 1
10
The value will be minimized when the operations are performed in the following order: A, A, B, B.
In this case, the value will change as follows: 1 → 2 → 4 → 7 → 10.  

Sample Input 2
10
10

Sample Output 2
76
The value will be minimized when the operations are performed in the following order: A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, B, B.
In this case, the value will change as follows: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 26 → 36 → 46 → 56 → 66 → 76.
