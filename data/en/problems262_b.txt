Problem Statement
You are given a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges.  The vertices are numbered 1, dots, N, and the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ M) edge connects Vertex U_i and Vertex V_i.
Find the number of tuples of integers a, b, c that satisfy all of the following conditions:
1 ≦ a < b < c ≦ N
There is an edge connecting Vertex a and Vertex b.
There is an edge connecting Vertex b and Vertex c.
There is an edge connecting Vertex c and Vertex a.

Constraints
3 ≦ N ≦ 100
1 ≦ M ≦ frac{N(N - 1)}{2}
1 ≦ U_i < V_i ≦ N , (1 ≦ i ≦ M)
(U_i, V_i) neq (U_j, V_j) , (i neq j)
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
U_1 V_1
vdots
U_M V_M
