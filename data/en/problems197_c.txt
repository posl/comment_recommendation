Problem Statement
Given is a number sequence A of length N.
Let us divide this sequence into one or more non-empty contiguous intervals.
Then, for each of these intervals, let us compute the bitwise [OR] of the numbers in it.
Find the minimum possible value of the bitwise [XOR] of the values obtained in this way.
        What is bitwise [OR]?
    
        The bitwise [OR] of integers A and B, A [OR] B, is defined as follows:
        
When A [OR] B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k ≧ 0) is 1 if at least one of A and B is 1, and 0 otherwise.
        For example, we have 3 [OR] 5 = 7 (in base two: 011 [OR] 101 = 111).  
        Generally, the bitwise [OR] of k integers p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_k is defined as (... ((p_1 [OR] p_2) [OR] p_3) [OR] ... [OR] p_k). We can prove that this value does not depend on the order of p_1, p_2, p_3, ... p_k.
    

        What is bitwise [XOR]?
    
        The bitwise [XOR] of integers A and B, A [XOR] B, is defined as follows:
        
When A [XOR] B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k ≧ 0) is 1 if exactly one of A and B is 1, and 0 otherwise.
        For example, we have 3 [XOR] 5 = 6 (in base two: 011 [XOR] 101 = 110).  
        Generally, the bitwise [XOR] of k integers p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_k is defined as (... ((p_1 [XOR] p_2) [XOR] p_3) [XOR] ... [XOR] p_k). We can prove that this value does not depend on the order of p_1, p_2, p_3, ... p_k.
    

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 20
0 ≦ A_i < 2^{30}
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 A_3 ... A_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
3
1 5 7

Sample Output 1
2
If we divide [1, 5, 7] into [1, 5] and [7], their bitwise [OR]s are 5 and 7, whose [XOR] is 2.
It is impossible to get a smaller result, so we print 2.

Sample Input 2
3
10 10 10

Sample Output 2
0
We should divide this sequence into [10] and [10, 10].

Sample Input 3
4
1 3 3 1

Sample Output 3
0
We should divide this sequence into [1, 3] and [3, 1].
