Problem Statement
Takahashi, the magician, is fighting with a monster.
He can use N spells.
The i-th spell takes X_i seconds to cast and has a power Y_i.
However, the monster is strong enough to avoid taking damage from spells taking S or more seconds to cast and spells with powers D or less.
Also, there is nothing other than spells that can do damage to the monster.
Can Takahashi do damage to the monster?  

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ X_i ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ Y_i ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ S ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ D ≤ 10^9

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N S D
X_1 Y_1
vdots

The second and fourth spells take too much time to do damage.
Also, the first and second spells do not have enough powers to do damage.
Thus, only the third spell can do damage.
