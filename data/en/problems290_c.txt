Problem Statement
You are given a length-N sequence of non-negative integers.
When B is a sequence obtained by choosing K elements from A and concatenating them without changing the order, find the maximum possible value of MEX(B).
Here, for a sequence X, we define MEX(X) as the unique non-negative integer m that satisfies the following conditions:
Every integer i such that 0 ≦ i < m is contained in X.
m is not contained in X.

Constraints
All values in the input are integers.
1 ≦ K ≦ N ≦ 3 × 10^5
0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
7 3
2 0 2 3 2 1 9

Sample Output 1
3
In this input, A=(2,0,2,3,2,1,9), and you obtain the sequence B by picking K=3 elements.  For example,
If the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd elements are chosen, MEX(B)=MEX(2,0,2)=1.
If the 3-rd, 4-th, and 6-th elements are chosen, MEX(B)=MEX(2,3,1)=0.
If the 2-nd, 6-th, and 7-th elements are chosen, MEX(B)=MEX(0,1,9)=2.
If the 2-nd, 3-rd, and 6-th elements are chosen, MEX(B)=MEX(0,2,1)=3.
The maximum possible MEX is 3.
