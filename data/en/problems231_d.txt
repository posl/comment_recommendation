Problem Statement
Determine whether there is a way to line up N people, numbered 1 to N, in a row side by side to satisfy all of the M conditions in the following format.
Condition: Person A_i and Person B_i are adjacent.

Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
0 ≦ M ≦ 10^5
1≦ A_i < B_i ≦ N
All pairs (A_i,B_i) are distinct.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 B_1
vdots
A_M B_M

Output
If there is a way to line up people to satisfy the conditions, print Yes; if not, print No.

Sample Input 1
4 2
1 3
2 3

Sample Output 1
Yes
One way to satisfy all the conditions is to line them up in the order 4,1,3,2.

Sample Input 2
4 3
1 4
2 4
3 4
