Problem Statement
Takahashi made N problems for competitive programming.
The problems are numbered 1 to N, and the difficulty of Problem i is represented as an integer d_i (the higher, the harder).
He is dividing the problems into two categories by choosing an integer K, as follows:
A problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.
A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.
How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?

Problem Statement
2 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
N is an even number.
1 ≦ d_i ≦ 10^5
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
d_1 d_2 ... d_N

Output
Print the number of choices of the integer K that make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same.

Sample Input 1
6
9 1 4 4 6 7

Sample Output 1
2
If we choose K=5 or 6, Problem 1, 5, and 6 will be for ARCs, Problem 2, 3, and 4 will be for ABCs, and the objective is achieved.
Thus, the answer is 2.
