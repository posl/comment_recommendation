Problem Statement
There are N people numbered 1 to N.
Person i guessed the building area of KEYENCE headquarters building to be S_i square meters.
The shape of KEYENCE headquarters building is shown below, where a and b are some positive integers.
That is, the building area of the building can be represented as 4ab+3a+3b.
Based on just this information, how many of the N people are guaranteed to be wrong in their guesses?

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 20
1 ≦ S_i ≦ 1000
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1 ... S_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
3
10 20 39

Sample Output 1
1
The area would be 10 square meters if a=1,b=1, and 39 square meters if a=2,b=3.
However, no pair of positive integers a and b would make the area 20 square meters.
Thus, we can only be sure that Person 2 guessed wrong.
