Problem Statement
Having learned the multiplication table, Takahashi can multiply two integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) together. He cannot do any other calculation.
Given are two integers A and B.
If Takahashi can calculate A times B, print the result; if he cannot, print -1 instead.

Constraints
1 ≦ A ≦ 20
1 ≦ B ≦ 20
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output
If Takahashi can calculate A times B, print the result; if he cannot, print -1.

Sample Input 1
2 5

Sample Output 1
10
2 times 5 = 10.

Sample Input 2
5 10

Sample Output 2
-1
5times 10 = 50, but Takahashi cannot do this calculation, so print -1 instead.

Sample Input 3
9 9

Sample Output 3
81
