Problem Statement
For an integer N, we will choose a permutation {P_1, P_2, ..., P_N} of {1, 2, ..., N}.
Then, for each i=1,2,...,N, let M_i be the remainder when i is divided by P_i.
Find the maximum possible value of M_1 + M_2 + cdots + M_N.

Constraints
N is an integer satisfying 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^9.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output
Print the maximum possible value of M_1 + M_2 + cdots + M_N.

Sample Input 1
2
