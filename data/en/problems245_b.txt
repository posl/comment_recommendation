Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of length N consisting of integers: A=(A_1,...,A_N).
Find the smallest non-negative integer not in (A_1,...,A_N).

Constraints
1 ≦ N ≦ 2000
0 ≦ A_i ≦ 2000
All values in input are integers.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 ... A_N

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
8
0 3 2 6 2 1 0 0

Sample Output 1
4
The non-negative integers are 0,1,2,3,4,....
We have 0,1,2,3 in A, but not 4, so the answer is 4.

Sample Input 2
3
2000 2000 2000
