Problem Statement
The republic of AtCoder has N cities numbered 1 through N and M roads numbered 1 through M.
Road i leads from City A_i to City B_i, but you cannot use it to get from City B_i to City A_i.
Puma is planning her journey where she starts at some city, travels along zero or more roads, and finishes at some city.
How many pairs of cities can be the origin and destination of Puma's journey? We distinguish pairs with the same set of cities in different orders.

Constraints
2 ≦ N ≦ 2000
0 ≦ M ≦ min(2000,N(N-1))
1 ≦ A_i,B_i ≦ N
A_i neq B_i
(A_i,B_i) are distinct.
All values in input are integers.
