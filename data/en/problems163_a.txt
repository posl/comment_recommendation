Problem Statement
Print the circumference of a circle of radius R.

Constraints
1 ≦ R ≦ 100
All values in input are integers.

InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
R

Output
Print the circumference of the circle.
Your output is considered correct if and only if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-2}.

Sample Input 1
1

Sample Output 1
6.28318530717958623200
Since we accept an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-2}, 6.28 is also an acceptable output, but 6 is not.

Sample Input 2
73

Sample Output 2
458.67252742410977361942
