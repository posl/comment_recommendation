I was able to solve this problem with the following code. However, I don't think it is the best way to solve this problem. I think there is a better way to solve this problem. I would like to know how to solve this problem in a better way.

I'm not sure if this is a good way, but I found a way to solve it.

I think it's a good idea to use the prime factorization of the number to solve this problem.

For example, if we want to know how many integers are similar to 250 less than 1000, we can use the prime factorization of 250 to factorize it as 2 × 5 × 5 × 5.

We can see that the number of factors of 1000 is 7, and the number of factors of 250 is 3. So the number of numbers similar to 250 is 7 - 3 = 4.

However, this method does not work for numbers greater than 1000. The reason is that the number of factors of 1000 is 7, and the number of factors of 250 is 3. So the number of numbers similar to 250 is 7 - 3 = 4.
