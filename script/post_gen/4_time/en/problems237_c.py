I used this code to solve this problem. However, the time limit is exceeded. Can anyone help me?

The time complexity of your code is O(N^2) . This is because you are checking whether a string is a palindrome or not, which has a time complexity of O(N) , and you are doing this for N times.

You can use KMP algorithm to solve this problem. The time complexity of KMP algorithm is O(N) , so it can pass the time limit.

Here is a reference to the KMP algorithm.

KMP algorithm

@kotetsu_kun Thank you for your advice. I will try it.

@kotetsu_kun I have tried to solve this problem using KMP algorithm. However, I don't know how to solve it. Can you help me?

I am not good at KMP algorithm. I don't know how to solve it. Can you help me?

I think you can use the KMP algorithm to solve this problem. Here is a reference to the KMP algorithm.
