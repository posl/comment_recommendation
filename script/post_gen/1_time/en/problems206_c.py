I've been trying to solve this problem for a while now, and I keep getting the wrong answer. I've tried using a dictionary and a list, but I can't get it to work. I've also tried using a counter, but I can't get it to work either. I'm not sure what else to try, so I was wondering if anyone could help me out.

Suggestion 6

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int,input().split()))
    s = set(a)
    d = {}
    for i in s:
        d[i] = a.count(i)
    ans = 0
    for i in d.values():
        ans += i*(n-i)
    print(ans//2)

    cnt = 1
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] == A[i+1]:
            cnt += 1

Suggestion 10

        elif i == n-1:
            if a[i] != a[i-1]:
                ans += 1

I solved this problem by using the sorted function to sort the array, and then I just had to check if the elements of the array were equal to the element before and after them. If they werenâ€™t, then I added 1 to the answer. I got a score of 100.
