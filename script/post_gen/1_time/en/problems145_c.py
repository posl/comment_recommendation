I am trying to calculate the average length of all the possible paths in a graph. I have written a recursive function that will calculate the length of all the paths, but I am having trouble calculating the average. I have tried to calculate the average by multiplying the total length of all the paths by a factor of 1/N! and that does not seem to be working. I am not sure why. Any help would be appreciated.
