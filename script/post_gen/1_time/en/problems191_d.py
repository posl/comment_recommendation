I was not able to solve this problem and I copied the solution from here. I don't understand the solution. Can someone explain it to me? I'm a beginner at Python.

The problem is to find the number of points within the circle that are also on the grid. The solution is to check each point on the grid to see if it is within the circle.

The first part of the solution is to get the coordinates of the corners of the square that bounds the circle. The next part is to check each point in the square to see if it is within the circle. The last part is to count the number of points that are within the circle.

I don't understand what you mean by the first part of the solution. Can you explain it to me?

The first part of the solution is to get the coordinates of the corners of the square that bounds the circle.

The circle is bounded by a square. The square is bounded by the points (X1, Y1), (X1, Y2), (X2, Y1), and (X2, Y2). The coordinates of these points are calculated in the first part of the solution.

The next part is to check each point in the square to see if it is within the circle.

The last part is to count the number of points that are within the circle.

Note: I am not sure if this is the best solution, but it works.

The problem is that the test cases are not accurate. I am not sure if the problem is with the test cases or the problem itself.

I have tried to solve this problem in Python and JavaScript, but I am not sure if I am doing it right. I am not sure if the problem is with the test cases or the problem itself. The problem statement is as follows:

We have a circle of radius R centered at (X, Y).
Find the number of grid points (points whose x- and y-coordinates are both integers) within or on the circle.

Constraints
|X| ≦ 10^5
|Y| ≦ 10^5
0 < R ≦ 10^5
Each of X, Y, and R has at most four digits after the decimal point.

Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y R

Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input 1
0.2 0.8 1.1

Sample Output 1
3
The circle is shown below. The grid points within or on the circle are marked red.

Sample Input 2
100 100 1

Sample Output 2
5
X, Y, and R may not have decimal points.
Note that we also count the grid points on the circle.

Sample Input 3
42782.4720 31949.0192 99999.99

Sample Output 3
31415920098

Here is my Python code:

X, Y, R = input().split()
X = float(X)
Y = float(Y)
R = float(R)
#print(X, Y, R)
x = int(X)
y = int(Y)
r =
