#Problem Statement
#Takahashi is participating in a programming contest called AXC002, and he has just submitted his code to Problem A.
#The problem has N test cases.
#For each test case i (1≦ i ≦ N), you are given a string S_i representing the verdict for that test case. Find the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is AC, WA, TLE, and RE, respectively.
#See the Output section for the output format.
#
#Constraints
#1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
#S_i is AC, WA, TLE, or RE.
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#N
#S_1
#.
#.
#.
#S_N
#
#Output
#Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is AC, WA, TLE, and RE, respectively. Print the following:
#AC x C_0
#WA x C_1
#TLE x C_2
#RE x C_3
#
#Sample Input 1
#6
#AC
#TLE
#AC
#AC
#WA
#TLE
#
#Sample Output 1
#AC x 3
#WA x 1
#TLE x 2
#RE x 0
#We have 3, 1, 2, and 0 test case(s) for which the verdict is AC, WA, TLE, and RE, respectively.
#
#Sample Input 2
#10
