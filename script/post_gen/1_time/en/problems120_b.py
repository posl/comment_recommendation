This is the first time I’ve ever written a program in Python. I have to admit, I’m a bit surprised how easy it is to write. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m used to writing in C/C++, or if it’s because Python is just a really easy language to write in. I’m sure it’s a combination of the two. I’m also not very familiar with Python’s standard library, so I’m not sure how much of the code I wrote is “standard” or not. I’m sure there are lots of ways to make the code more efficient and simpler, but I think this is a good start.

I’m not sure if I’m going to continue writing in Python. It’s a nice language to write in, but I’m not sure if it’s the best language for me. I’m going to continue writing in C/C++ and Java for the time being, and see how I feel about them. If I feel like I’m not learning anything, I’ll probably switch over to Python.
