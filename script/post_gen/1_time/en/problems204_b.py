Suggestion 1

def main():
    N = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] > 10:
            ans += A[i] - 10
    print(ans)

main()

The problem statement is as follows:

There are N trees. The i-th tree bears A_i nuts.

Chipmunk will harvest nuts from the trees in the following manner:

From a tree with 10 or fewer nuts, she does not take nuts.

From a tree with more than 10 nuts, she takes all but 10 nuts.

Find the total number of nuts Chipmunk will take from the trees.

Constraints

1 ≦ N ≦ 1000

0 ≦ A_i ≦ 1000

All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
A_1 ... A_N

Output

Print the answer.

Sample Input 1

3
6 17 28

Sample Output 1

25

From the three trees, Chipmunk will take 0, 7, and 18 nuts, for a total of 25 nuts.

Sample Input 2

4
8 9 10 11

Sample Output 2

1

The first sample input is a simple case where the number of nuts taken from each tree is less than 10. The second sample input is a case where the number of nuts taken from some trees is 10.

My solution is as follows:
