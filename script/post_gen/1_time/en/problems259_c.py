#Problem Statement
#You are given two strings S and T.
#Determine whether it is possible to make S equal T by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero).
#Between two consecutive equal characters in S, insert a character equal to these characters.
#That is, take the following three steps.
#Let N be the current length of S, and S = S_1S_2... S_N.
#Choose an integer i between 1 and N-1 (inclusive) such that S_i = S_{i+1}. (If there is no such i, do nothing and terminate the operation now, skipping step 3.)
#Insert a single copy of the character S_i(= S_{i+1}) between the i-th and (i+1)-th characters of S. Now, S is a string of length N+1: S_1S_2... S_i S_i S_{i+1} ... S_N.
#
#
#Constraints
#Each of S and T is a string of length between 2 and 2 Ã— 10^5 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#S
#T
#
#Output
#If it is possible to make S equal T, print Yes; otherwise, print No.
#Note that the judge is case-sensitive.
#
#Sample Input 1
#abbaac
#abbbbaaac
#
#Sample Output 1
#Yes
#You can make S = abbaac equal T = abbbbaaac by the following three operations.
#First, insert b between the 2-nd and 3-rd characters of S. Now, S = abbbaac.
#Next, insert b again between the 2-nd and 3-rd characters of S. Now, S = abbbbaac.
#Lastly, insert a between the 6-th and 7-th characters of S. Now, S = abbbbaaac.
#Thus, Yes should be printed.
#
#Sample Input 2
#xyzz
#xyyzz
#
#Sample Output 2
#No
#No sequence of operations makes S = xyzz equal T = xyyzz.
#Thus, No should be printed.
