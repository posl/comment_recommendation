def f(x):
    return x**2 + 2*x + 3

t = int(input())
print(f(f(f(t)+t)+f(f(t))))

Suggestion 2

def f(x):
    return x * x + 2 * x + 3

t = int(input())
print(f(f(f(t) + t) + f(f(t))))

Suggestion 5

def f(x):
    return x**2 + 2*x + 3

t = int(input())
print(f(f(f(t)+t)+f(f(t))))

This is a very interesting problem. I was able to solve it with the help of the following code.

Suggestion 6

def f(x):
    return x*x + 2*x + 3

t = int(input())
print(f(f(f(t)+t)+f(f(t))))

The solution above is correct, but it is not efficient. In fact, it is a brute-force solution. You can find a more efficient solution below.
