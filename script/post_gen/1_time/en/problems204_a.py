Suggestion 8

def main():
    # Read the input
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the answer
    if x == y:
        answer = x
    elif x != y:
        answer = 3 - x - y
    # Print the answer
    print(answer)

    print((x + 1) % 3)

main()

This is a very simple problem, and I think it is better to solve it without using any extra libraries. I have used the map function to map the input to an integer. I have used the modulo operator to find the remainder of the sum of x and 1 divided by 3. The remainder will be the answer.

The problem is solved.
