Hi, I'm a beginner in programming and I'm learning python. I'm trying to make a program that will calculate the factorial of a number. I'm trying to use recursion but I'm not sure how to code it. I've tried to use recursion but I keep getting errors. Here's my code:

I have a list of 3 numbers, which I want to use as the first 3 numbers in a sequence of numbers. The next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous 3 numbers. I want to use this list of 3 numbers to generate a sequence of numbers with a length of 1000. I have tried to use a for loop, but I'm not sure how to do it. I'm also not sure how to generate the sequence of numbers. Any help would be appreciated.

I am trying to make a program that will take a list of numbers and then sort them into 2 lists. The first list will have all the even numbers and the second list will have all the odd numbers. I am trying to do this using a for loop and an if statement but I am not sure how to go about doing this. I have tried a couple of different ways but none of them have worked. Any help would be appreciated.
