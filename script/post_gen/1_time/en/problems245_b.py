This is a problem from the AtCoder Beginner Contest 245. The problem statement can be found here.

The problem is simple enough. Given a sequence of integers, find the smallest non-negative integer not in the sequence.

The first thing that comes to mind is to sort the sequence and then iterate through it, keeping track of the smallest non-negative integer not in the sequence. However, sorting the sequence is not necessary. We can use a set to keep track of the integers in the sequence. This way, we can iterate through a range of integers and see if the integer is in the set. If it isn’t, then we have found the smallest non-negative integer not in the sequence.

The time complexity is O(N) and the space complexity is O(N).

The problem is that the code is not working for the first sample input given. The output is 0. The expected output is 4. I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Please help.

I am new to this so I am not sure if I am doing this right. I am trying to create a program that takes a list of numbers and then returns the sum of the list. I have the sum function working but I am not sure how to get the list to be inputted into the function. I am using a while loop to keep asking for input until the user inputs "done". I have tried using a list.append() function but that doesn't seem to work. Any help would be appreciated.
