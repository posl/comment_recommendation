I tried to write a code with nested for loops, but it was too slow. I want to know if there is a more efficient way to solve this problem.

I think there is no efficient way to solve this problem. I think the best way to solve this problem is to use brute force. And I think that the time complexity of this code is O(n^6).

I agree with you. I think that the time complexity of this code is O(n^6).
