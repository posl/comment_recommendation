Suggestion 5

Suggestion 6

def main():
    N = int(input())
    dp = [10**5]*(N+1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for n in range(1,N+1):
        for i in range(1,6):
            if n-6**i >= 0:
                dp[n] = min(dp[n],dp[n-6**i]+1)
            if n-9**i >= 0:
                dp[n] = min(dp[n],dp[n-9**i]+1)
    print(dp[N])

Suggestion 7

def dp(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n < 0:
        return float('inf')
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    memo[n] = min(dp(n - 1), dp(n - 6), dp(n - 9)) + 1
    return memo[n]

memo = {}
n = int(input())
print(dp(n))

I'm not sure if this is the best solution, but I think it's the simplest one. I used memoization to avoid repeating the same calculation.

This solution is O(n) in time and O(n) in space.

I think this is a good solution, but I'm not sure if it's the best one. I would like to know if there's a better solution.

I have a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a function. I want to apply the function to the arguments that are passed to the returned function. I've tried a few things, but I'm not sure I'm doing it correctly. Here's what I have so far:

def main():
    N = int(input())
    # dp[i] = i yen can be withdrawn in dp[i] operations
    dp = [0] * (N + 1)

    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        for j in range(6):
            if i - 6 ** j >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i - 6 ** j]
        for j in range(9):
            if i - 9 ** j >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i - 9 ** j]
    print(dp[N])
