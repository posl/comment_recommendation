I have a list of lists, and I want to sort it by the first element of each list, but I want to sort it in a way that the first list is the one with the smallest first element, and the last list is the one with the largest first element. I know that I can use the sorted() function to sort the list, but I am not sure how to sort it in the way that I want it to be sorted. Here is an example of what I want to sort:

[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]]

I want it to be sorted like this:

[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]]

I am trying to write a program that will take the name of a file and a number n as input, and then output the first n lines of the file. I am trying to use the readline() function to read the lines of the file, but when I try to run the code, I get the error: "TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not int". I am not sure why I am getting this error, because I am not sure what the error means. Here is my code:
