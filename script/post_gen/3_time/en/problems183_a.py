        return x
    else:
        return 0

x = int(input())
print(ReLU(x))

print(relu(x))

The above code is my solution to this problem. I think it is very simple and easy to understand. As you can see, the function relu() is very simple. It just checks if the input x is less than 0 or not. If it is less than 0, it will return 0. If it is not, it will return x.

The code above is the python code to this problem. You can also see the code in the following link.
