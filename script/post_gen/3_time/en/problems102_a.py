I don’t know why I’m getting an error in the last test case.

The error is:

Time Limit Exceeded

The program is running for too long. Please check the correctness of your program.

I don’t know what to do.

I’ve tried to use the same approach as the first problem and it worked.

I’ve also tried to use the same approach as the second problem and it didn’t work.

I’m really confused.

Can someone help me?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

I think the problem is that you are not taking into account the fact that the number has to be divisible by 2. You are only checking if it is divisible by N.

I’m sorry, but I don’t understand what you mean.

Oh, I see.

I didn’t know that I had to check if the number is divisible by 2.

I’m really sorry.

I’ll try to fix it.

Thank you very much.

I fixed it and now it’s working.

Thank you very much.
