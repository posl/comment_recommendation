Suggestion 1

def main():
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    print((a + b) * (c - d))
    print("Takahashi")

Suggestion 2

def main():
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    print((a + b) * (c - d))
    print('Takahashi')

Suggestion 3

def main():
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    print(a * b - c * d)
    print("Takahashi")

Suggestion 4

def main():
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    print((a + b) * (c - d))
    print("Takahashi")
main()

a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
print((a + b) * (c - d))
print("Takahashi")

In the first line, we can use map to convert a string to an integer. This is a common technique in Python. In the second line, we can use the print function to print the result. Here, we can print multiple values by separating them with commas. The print function automatically inserts a space between the values. In the third line, we can print a string using the print function. The print function automatically inserts a new line character at the end of the string. Note that the print function automatically inserts a new line character at the end of the string. Therefore, we do not need to add a new line character at the end of the string.

The following is a sample input and output.

Sample Input 1
1 2 5 3

Sample Output 1
6
Takahashi

Sample Input 2
10 -20 30 -40

Sample Output 2
-700
Takahashi

Sample Input 3
100 100 100 -100

Sample Output 3
40000
Takahashi

This is the code I have written. I am getting the correct output for the first two test cases, but for the third test case, I am getting the wrong answer. I am getting the output as 4000 instead of 40000. Can anyone help me to figure out what I am doing wrong?

Thank you in advance.

The problem is with the last line of your code. You have written print("Takahashi") . But the question asks you to print Takahashi (without any quotes). So, you can simply remove the quotes.
