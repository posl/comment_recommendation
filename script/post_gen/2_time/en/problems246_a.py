main()

I have a problem with the code. It is giving me a runtime error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "problems246_a.py", line 40, in <module>
    main()
  File "problems246_a.py", line 38, in main
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)

I have tried to debug the code and it seems that the input is not being read correctly. I have tried to change the input() to raw_input() and it still gives me the same error. I have also tried to change the input to sys.stdin.readline() and it still gives me the same error.

Any help would be appreciated.

I think you are missing the newline character at the end of each line. When you use input() , it reads until the newline character. If you have a file with no newline characters at the end of each line, then you will get this error.

I think you are missing the newline
