I thought that the problem was to find the minimum number of operations required to make all the numbers equal. I thought that I should divide the number by 2 or 3 as many times as possible. The number of operations is the sum of the number of times each number is divided by 2 and the number of times each number is divided by 3. I thought that the number of times each number is divided by 2 is the number of times the number is even. I thought that the number of times each number is divided by 3 is the number of times the number is a multiple of 3. I thought that if the number is not a multiple of 2 or 3, then it cannot be made equal to other numbers. I thought that if the number is not 1, then it cannot be made equal to other numbers. I thought that if the number is 1, then it can be made equal to other numbers.
