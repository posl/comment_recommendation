main()

I am not sure if this is the best way to solve this problem, but it works.

I think the problem is that the problem ID is not a base 26 number. It is a base 26 number, with the digits starting at 1 instead of 0. So, the problem ID "AB" is 26 + 2 = 28, not 26 * 1 + 2 = 28.

I think you are right. I will try to solve it again.

I think I have found a solution that works. I think it is a little bit more elegant than the one I posted before.
