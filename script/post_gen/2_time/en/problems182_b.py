I solved this problem by using the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element of the sequence and the other elements. I then calculated the GCD-ness of each integer greater than or equal to 2. The integer with the greatest GCD-ness is the answer.

I tried to solve this problem without using the Euclidean algorithm, but I couldn't find a solution. I think the Euclidean algorithm is the best way to solve this problem.

I also tried to solve this problem using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but I couldn't find a solution. I think the Sieve of Eratosthenes is not the best way to solve this problem.
