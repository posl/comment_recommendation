def gcd(a, b):
    if a < b:
        a, b = b, a
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

Suggestion 2

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

=======
Suggestion 3

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)

Suggestion 4

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)

N, X = map(int, input().split())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
x.append(X)
x.sort()
x = [abs(i - X) for i in x]
x = [i for i in x if i != 0]
ans = x[0]
for i in range(1, len(x)):
    ans = gcd(ans, x[i])
print(ans)

Suggestion 5

def solve():
    N, X = map(int, input().split())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x.sort()
    if N == 1:
        print(x[0] - X)
        return
    ans = x[1] - x[0]
    for i in range(2, N):
        ans = gcd(ans, x[i] - x[i - 1])
    print(ans)

Suggestion 6

def gcd(a,b):
    while b:
        a,b = b,a%b
    return a

N,X = map(int,input().split())
Xs = list(map(int,input().split()))
Xs.append(X)
Xs.sort()
D = Xs[1]-Xs[0]
for i in range(1,N):
    D = gcd(D,Xs[i+1]-Xs[i])
print(D)

I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way to do this, but it works.

Suggestion 7

def gcd(a,b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b,a%b)

n,x=map(int,input().split())
xlist=list(map(int,input().split()))
xlist.sort()
xlist=[i-x for i in xlist]
d=abs(xlist[0])
for i in xlist:
    d=gcd(d,abs(i))
print(d)

It's not the fastest solution, but it's a nice one-liner. It's a bit slow on the last sample input, but I think that's because of the gcd function. I'm not sure how to improve it.

I'm a bit confused about the problem statement. Can there be multiple cities at the same coordinate? Or are all the coordinates different?

There are no cities at the same coordinate.

The coordinates are different. The statement is a bit confusing though.

I've tried to make it clea
