I'm not sure what you mean by "directly connected", but if you mean that there is a unique path between every pair of vertices, then that is not necessarily the case. Consider the following graph:

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9

This is a star, but there is no unique path between every pair of vertices.

I'm sorry for my poor English. I mean that there is a vertex directly connected to all other vertices.

Ah, that makes more sense. In that case, you can use the following algorithm:

Let v be the vertex that is directly connected to all other vertices.

Let E be the set of edges in the graph.

Let V be the set of vertices in the graph.
