I'm not sure what the problem is. I'm trying to find the number of odd numbers with exactly eight positive divisors between 1 and N (inclusive). I'm doing this by creating a function that will count the number of divisors that a number has. Then I loop through all the numbers between 1 and N and count the number of odd numbers with 8 divisors. I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way to do this, but it works. I'm just not sure if it's the most efficient way to do this. Is there a better way to do this?

Of course there is. First, you don't need to check all the odd numbers between 1 and N . You only need to check the odd numbers between 1 and N/2 . Second, your divisors() function is inefficient. You can easily find the number of divisors of a number n by counting the powers of the prime factors of n . You can also do this in a more efficient way by using the fact that the number of divisors of n is equal to the product of (p+1) for all prime factors p .

            if n // i != i:
                count += 1
    return count

def getDivisors(n):
    divisors = [1]
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n/i:
                divisors.append(n/i)
    return len(divisors)

n = int(input())
count = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i % 2 == 1 and getDivisors(i) == 8:
        count += 1
print(count)

I got 100% on this one. I think the only thing that could be improved is the getDivisors function. It's not the most efficient way to find divisors.

I'm a bit late to the party, but I wanted to post my solution anyway. I'm not sure if it's the most efficient solution, but it's the first one I came up with.
