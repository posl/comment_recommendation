The problem statement says that the operation is repeated 10^18 times. However, it is not necessary to repeat the operation 10^18 times. It is sufficient to repeat the operation 3 times.

The operation is repeated 3 times. Thus, the color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is the same as the color of the hat of Takahashi 2 or the color of the hat of Takahashi 3. The color of the hat of Takahashi 2 is the same as the color of the hat of Takahashi 3. Thus, the color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is the same as the color of the hat of Takahashi 3. If the color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is different from the color of the hat of Takahashi 3, the color of the hat of Takahashi 2 is different from the color of the hat of Takahashi 3. Thus, the color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is the same as the color of the hat of Takahashi 2.

The color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is the same as the color of the hat of Takahashi 2. The color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is different from the color of the hat of Takahashi 3.

The color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is the same as the color of the hat of Takahashi 3. The color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is different from the color of the hat of Takahashi 2.

The color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is different from the color of the hat of Takahashi 2. The color of the hat of Takahashi 1 is different from the color of the hat of Takahashi 3. The color of the hat of Takahashi 2 is different from the color of the
