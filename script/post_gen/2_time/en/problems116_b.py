Synthesizing 10/10 solutions (Duplicates hidden)

Suggestion 1

def f(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2
    else:
        return 3 * n + 1

s = int(input())
a = [s]
while True:
    a.append(f(a[-1]))
    if a[-1] in a[:-1]:
        print(len(a))
        break

Suggestion 2

def f(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2
    else:
        return 3 * n + 1

s = int(input())
a = [s]
while True:
    a.append(f(a[-1]))
    if a[-1] in a[:-1]:
        break
print(len(a))

You can also use a while loop to get the same result.

s = int(input())
a = [s]
while a[-1] not in a[:-1]:
    a.append(f(a[-1]))
print(len(a))

The reason why the second solution is faster is that the first solution checks the condition a[-1] in a[:-1] every time, while the second solution checks it only once.

When you use the second solution, you can also shorten the code as follows.

s = int(input())
a = [s]
while a[-1] not in a[:-1]:
    a.append(f(a[-1]))
print(len(a))

def main():

    while True:
        if a[-1] % 2 == 0:
            a.append(a[-1]//2)

            a.append(3*a[-1]+1)

Suggestion 4

def f(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n / 2
    else:
        return 3 * n + 1

s = int(input())
a = [s]
while True:
    a.append(f(a[-1]))
    if len(a) != len(set(a)):
        print(len(a))
        break

I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it, but I think it's pretty neat. I use the set function to get rid of all duplicates, and then compare the length of the list to the length of the set. If they are not the same, that means there are duplicates, and I can print the length of the list.

I think it's better to use a dictionary instead of a list in this case.

I agree with you. I will try it.

I have changed the code. I think it's better than before.

I got the right answer, but I don't know if this is the best way to solve this problem. I would appreciate it if you could tell me if there is a better way to solve this problem.

I have a problem with my code. It is giving me a wrong answer. I have checked it with the sample inputs but it is not working. I have used a while loop and a list. I would like to know what is wrong with my code.
