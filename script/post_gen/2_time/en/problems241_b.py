The problem is to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal. The graph is given by a 2D array. 0 is a wall and 1 is a free space. The cost of moving from one point to an adjacent point is 1. The cost of moving from one point to a non-adjacent point is 10. The graph is connected. The starting point and the goal are given by two tuples.
