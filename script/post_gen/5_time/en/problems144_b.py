#Problem Statement
#Having learned the multiplication table, Takahashi can multiply two integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) together.
#Given an integer N, determine whether N can be represented as the product of two integers between 1 and 9. If it can, print Yes; if it cannot, print No.
#
#Constraints
#1 ≦ N ≦ 100
#N is an integer.
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#N
#
#Output
#If N can be represented as the product of two integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive), print Yes; if it cannot, print No.
#
#Sample Input 1
#10
#
#Sample Output 1
#Yes
#10 can be represented as, for example, 2 × 5.
#
#Sample Input 2
#50
#
#Sample Output 2
#No
#50 cannot be represented as the product of two integers between 1 and 9.
#
#Sample Input 3
#81
#
#Sample Output 3
#Yes
