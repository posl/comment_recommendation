#Problem Statement
#Among the positive integers that consist of 0's and 2's when written in base 10, find the K-th smallest integer.
#
#Constraints
#K is an integer between 1 and 10^{18} (inclusive).
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#K
#
#Output
#Print the answer as an integer.
#Here, the exact value must be printed as an integer, even if it is big. Exponential notations such as 2.34e+22, for example, or unnecessary leading zeros such as 0523 are not allowed.
#
#Sample Input 1
#3
#
#Sample Output 1
#22
#The positive integers that consist of 0's and 2's when written in base 10 are 2,20,22,... in ascending order.
#The (K=) 3-rd of them, which is 22, should be printed.
#
