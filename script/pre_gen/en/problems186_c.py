#Problem Statement
#Takahashi hates the number 7.
#We are interested in integers without the digit 7 in both decimal and octal. How many such integers are there between 1 and N (inclusive)?
#
#Constraints
#1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
#N is an integer.
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#N
#
#Output
#Print an integer representing the answer.
#
#Sample Input 1
#20
#
#Sample Output 1
#17
#Among the integers between 1 and 20, 7 and 17 contain the digit 7 in decimal. Additionally, 7 and 15 contain the digit 7 in octal.
#Thus, the 17 integers other than 7, 15, and 17 meet the requirement.
#
#Sample Input 2
#100000
#
#Sample Output 2
#30555
