#Problem Statement
#Given are 1-digit positive integers a and b. Consider these two strings: the concatenation of b copies of the digit a, and the concatenation of a copies of the digit b. Which of these is lexicographically smaller?
#
#Constraints
#1 ≦ a ≦ 9
#1 ≦ b ≦ 9
#a and b are integers.
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#a b
#
#Output
#Print the lexicographically smaller of the two strings. (If the two strings are equal, print one of them.)
#
#Sample Input 1
#4 3
#
#Sample Output 1
#3333
#We have two strings 444 and 3333. Between them, 3333 is the lexicographically smaller.
#
#Sample Input 2
#7 7
#
#Sample Output 2
#7777777
