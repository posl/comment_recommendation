#Problem Statement
#You are given two integer sequences, each of length N: a_1, ..., a_N and b_1, ..., b_N.
#There are N^2 ways to choose two integers i and j such that 1 ≦ i, j ≦ N. For each of these N^2 pairs, we will compute a_i + b_j and write it on a sheet of paper.
#That is, we will write N^2 integers in total.
#Compute the XOR of these N^2 integers.
#Definition of XOR
#The XOR of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m is defined as follows:
#Let the XOR be X. In the binary representation of X, the digit in the 2^k's place (0 ≦ k; k is an integer) is 1 if there are an odd number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representation has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 if that number is even.
#For example, let us compute the XOR of 3 and 5. The binary representation of 3 is 011, and the binary representation of 5 is 101, thus the XOR has the binary representation 110, that is, the XOR is 6.
#
#Constraints
#All input values are integers.
#1 ≦ N ≦ 200,000
#0 ≦ a_i, b_i < 2^{28}
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#N
#a_1 a_2 ... a_N
#b_1 b_2 ... b_N
#
#Output
#Print the result of the computation.
