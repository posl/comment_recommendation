#Problem Statement
#Based on some criterion, Snuke divided the integers from 1 through 12 into three groups as shown in the figure below.
#Given two integers x and y (1 ≤ x < y ≤ 12), determine whether they belong to the same group.
#
#
#Constraints
#x and y are integers.
#1 ≤ x < y ≤ 12
#
#Input
#Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
#x y
#
#Output
#If x and y belong to the same group, print Yes; otherwise, print No.
#
#Sample Input 1
#1 3
#
#Sample Output 1
#Yes
#
#Sample Input 2
#2 4
#
#Sample Output 2
