I like the idea of using a function to solve the problem. It makes it easier to read and understand what the code is doing. I also like how you are using the input() function to get the input from the user. I am not sure if this is the best way to solve the problem, but it is a good start. I hope you are able to find a solution that works for you.

Thank you for your comment! I will try to find a better way to solve the problem.
