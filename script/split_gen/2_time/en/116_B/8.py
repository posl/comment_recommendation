I got the right answer, but I don't know if this is the best way to solve this problem. I would appreciate it if you could tell me if there is a better way to solve this problem.
I have a problem with my code. It is giving me a wrong answer. I have checked it with the sample inputs but it is not working. I have used a while loop and a list. I would like to know what is wrong with my code.
