The answer is correct, but the time limit is exceeded. I am not sure how to improve the algorithm. Any suggestions?
I suspect you are doing a lot of unnecessary work. For each round, you are checking every pair of players, but you only need to check the pair of players that are playing each other. Also, you can use a binary heap to find the next pair of players to play each other.
I tried to use a binary heap, but it is still too slow. I am not sure how to improve the algorithm.

I'm not sure what you mean by "too slow". Can you post your code?
