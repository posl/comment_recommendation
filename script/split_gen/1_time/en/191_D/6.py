I was not able to solve this problem and I copied the solution from here. I don't understand the solution. Can someone explain it to me? I'm a beginner at Python.
The problem is to find the number of points within the circle that are also on the grid. The solution is to check each point on the grid to see if it is within the circle.
The first part of the solution is to get the coordinates of the corners of the square that bounds the circle. The next part is to check each point in the square to see if it is within the circle. The last part is to count the number of points that are within the circle.

I don't understand what you mean by the first part of the solution. Can you explain it to me?

The circle is bounded by a square. The square is bounded by the points (X1, Y1), (X1, Y2), (X2, Y1), and (X2, Y2). The coordinates of these points are calculated in the first part of the solution.
The next part is to check each point in the square to see if it is within the circle.
The last part is to count the number of points that are within the circle.
