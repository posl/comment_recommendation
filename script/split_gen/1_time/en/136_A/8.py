Hi, I am a student from India. I am interested in competitive programming and I am trying to learn Python. I am a beginner and I am trying to solve problems from AtCoder. I am trying to solve this problem https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc136/tasks/abc136_a. I am able to solve it using C++ but I am not able to solve it using Python. I am not able to understand the error I am getting. I am getting this error when I am trying to submit my code. I am getting this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
