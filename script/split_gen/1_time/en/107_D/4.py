I solved this problem in Python. I think this solution is not very efficient, but it seems to work. I would like to know if there are any other ways to solve this problem.

You can try to solve this problem using the following idea.
For each i, j, compute the number of elements in the range [i, j] that are less than or equal to a[i] and the number of elements in the range [i, j] that are greater than or equal to a[i] . Then, the median of m is the median of the sequence of (a[i], min(cnt1, cnt2)) for all i.
I think this solution is not very efficient, but it seems to work.
The time complexity of your solution is O(N^2 log N) . The time complexity of the solution I proposed is O(N log N) .
I am sorry, but I do not understand the solution you proposed. I would like to know how to solve this problem using the solution you proposed.

I am sorry for my poor explanation. I will try to explain more clearly.
For each i, j, compute the number of elements in the range [i, j] that are less than or equal to a[i] and the number of elements in the range [i, j] that are greater than or equal to a[i] .
For example, let a = (5, 9, 5, 9, 8, 9, 3, 5, 4, 3) . Then, cnt1[i][j] = 3 means that there are 3 elements in the range [i, j] that are less than or equal to a[i] . Similarly, cnt2[i][j] = 4 means that there are 4 elements in the range [i,
