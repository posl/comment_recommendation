I have a problem with the third test case. It says that the output should be "boxs", but it should be "boxes". Is it a typo or am I wrong?
I can't find any typo in the problem statement. I think it's a typo. Could someone confirm this?
I think it's a typo. I've seen people asking the same question on the forum, and the author of the problem said that it's a typo.
