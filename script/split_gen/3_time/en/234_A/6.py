def f(x):
    return x**2 + 2*x + 3
t = int(input())
print(f(f(f(t)+t)+f(f(t))))
This is the code for the problem. It is not the best solution, but it is the one I came up with. I am a beginner in Python, so please let me know if there is a better way to solve this problem.
I am trying to make a simple program to generate a random number between 1 and 10. I have made a simple program that does this, but I am having trouble with the if statements. The program is supposed to tell you if you are correct or not. I am having trouble with the elif statements, because I only want the program to tell you if you are correct, or if you are wrong. I don't want it to tell you if you are wrong and then tell you if you are correct. I am also having trouble with the else statement, because it is not working. The program is supposed to tell you if you are wrong, but it is not doing that. I am also having trouble with the while loop. I want the program to keep asking you to guess if you are wrong, but it is not doing that. Could someone please help me with this problem? Here is my code:
from random import randint
num = randint(1,10)
guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))
