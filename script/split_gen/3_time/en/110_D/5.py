I solved the problem by using the prime factorization of M. I think this is easy to understand.
First, I calculated the prime factorization of M. In this case, I used a dictionary to store the prime factorization. The key is the prime number and the value is the number of times it is repeated.
Then, I calculated the number of sequences satisfying the condition, using the prime factorization of M. For example, if M = 12, the prime factorization is {2: 2, 3: 1}. Then, the number of sequences satisfying the condition is (2+1) * (1+1) = 6. The number of sequences satisfying the condition is the product of (the number of repetitions of the prime number + 1). The number of repetitions of the prime number is the value of the dictionary.
I think the solution is not very efficient. I want to know if there is a better solution.
