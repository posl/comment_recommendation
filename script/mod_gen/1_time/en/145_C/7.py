I am trying to write a code that can calculate the average length of all paths that visit all towns once. I am using the itertools.permutations function to find all the paths. I am trying to calculate the length of each path, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to calculate the distance between each town, and then sum up all the distances. I am not sure how to calculate the distance between each town. I am trying to use the distance formula, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the math library, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the sqrt function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the pow function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the sum function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the len function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the round function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the format function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the input function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the map function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the int function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the split function, but I am not sure how to do that. I am trying to use the print function, but I am not sure how to do that.
