I have a problem with the “A” problem of the AtCoder Beginner Contest 262 in Python. I have the same problem with my other Python code for the “A” problem of the AtCoder Beginner Contest 262. I have received the same error message with both Python codes. I have tried to use a while loop to check if the year is divisible by 4 with a remainder of 2. If it is not divisible by 4 with a remainder of 2, then I add 1 to the year. I have tried to use a while loop to check if the year is divisible by 4 with a remainder of 2.
