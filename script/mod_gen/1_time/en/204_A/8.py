def main():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x + 1) % 3)
main()
This is a very simple problem, and I think it is better to solve it without using any extra libraries. I have used the map function to map the input to an integer. I have used the modulo operator to find the remainder of the sum of x and 1 divided by 3. The remainder will be the answer.
The problem is solved.
