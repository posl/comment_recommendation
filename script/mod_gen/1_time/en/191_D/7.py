Note: I am not sure if this is the best solution, but it works.
The problem is that the test cases are not accurate. I am not sure if the problem is with the test cases or the problem itself.
I have tried to solve this problem in Python and JavaScript, but I am not sure if I am doing it right. I am not sure if the problem is with the test cases or the problem itself. The problem statement is as follows:
We have a circle of radius R centered at (X, Y).
Find the number of grid points (points whose x- and y-coordinates are both integers) within or on the circle.
Constraints
|X| ≦ 10^5
|Y| ≦ 10^5
0 < R ≦ 10^5
Each of X, Y, and R has at most four digits after the decimal point.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y R
Output
Print the answer.
Sample Input 1
0.2 0.8 1.1
Sample Output 1
3
The circle is shown below. The grid points within or on the circle are marked red.
Sample Input 2
100 100 1
Sample Output 2
5
X, Y, and R may not have decimal points.
Note that we also count the grid points on the circle.
Sample Input 3
42782.4720 31949.0192 99999.99
Sample Output 3
31415920098
Here is my Python code:
X, Y, R = input().split()
X = float(X)
Y = float(Y)
R = float(R)
#print(X, Y, R)
x = int(X)
y = int(Y)
r =
