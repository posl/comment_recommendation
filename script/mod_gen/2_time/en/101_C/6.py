I am a beginner in competitive programming. I am trying to solve the problem "Snuke's Favorite Sequence" on AtCoder. I have read the editorial, but I can't understand how to solve it. The editorial says that the answer is the number of times the minimum value appears in the sequence. I am trying to solve it with dynamic programming, but I can't find a way to do it. Can someone help me?
The answer is the number of times the minimum value appears in the sequence.
How do you know that? I think it's a wrong answer.
I don't think it's a wrong answer. I have read the editorial, and it says that the answer is the number of times the minimum value appears in the sequence. I am trying to solve it with dynamic programming, but I can't find a way to do it.
I think the editorial is wrong. If you have a counterexample, please let me know.

Please show me the editorial. I don't know what you are talking about.

I think you can solve it without dynamic programming.
