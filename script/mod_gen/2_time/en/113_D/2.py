                dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j]) % mod
            else:
                dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % mod
                dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j]) % mod

I used the same method as the previous problem, but I made a mistake when I wrote the code. I wrote the following code:
dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % mod
dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j]) % mod
dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1]) % mod
However, this code is wrong. The correct code is as follows:
dp[i+1][j] += (dp[i][j-1] + dp[i][j] + dp[i][j+1]) % mod
I made a mistake because I didnâ€™t understand the meaning of the += operator. I should have written the following code:
dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + (dp[i][j-1] + dp[i][j] + dp[i][j+1
