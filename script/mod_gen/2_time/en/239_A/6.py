def findHorizon(h):
    return (h*(12800000+h))**(1/2)
h = int(input())
print(findHorizon(h))
I am trying to write a program that will take in a list of numbers and print out the numbers in a grid. I am having trouble getting the numbers to be aligned. Here is my code:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    findHorizon()
