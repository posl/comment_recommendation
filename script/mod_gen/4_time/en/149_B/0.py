I solved this problem in 10 minutes.
I thought that I could solve this problem by using the following logic:
If A is greater than K, then A will be reduced by K.
If A is less than or equal to K, then K will be reduced by A, and A will be reduced to 0.
If B is greater than or equal to K, then B will be reduced by K.
If B is less than K, then B will be reduced to 0.
I submitted my code, and it was accepted.
I think that this problem was very easy.
