def dp(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n < 0:
        return float('inf')
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    memo[n] = min(dp(n - 1), dp(n - 6), dp(n - 9)) + 1
    return memo[n]
memo = {}
n = int(input())
print(dp(n))
I'm not sure if this is the best solution, but I think it's the simplest one. I used memoization to avoid repeating the same calculation.
This solution is O(n) in time and O(n) in space.
I think this is a good solution, but I'm not sure if it's the best one. I would like to know if there's a better solution.
I have a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a function. I want to apply the function to the arguments that are passed to the returned function. I've tried a few things, but I'm not sure I'm doing it correctly. Here's what I have so far:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    dp()
