In the first line, we can use map to convert a string to an integer. This is a common technique in Python. In the second line, we can use the print function to print the result. Here, we can print multiple values by separating them with commas. The print function automatically inserts a space between the values. In the third line, we can print a string using the print function. The print function automatically inserts a new line character at the end of the string. Note that the print function automatically inserts a new line character at the end of the string. Therefore, we do not need to add a new line character at the end of the string.
The following is a sample input and output.
Sample Input 1
1 2 5 3
Sample Output 1

Sample Input 2
10 -20 30 -40
Sample Output 2
-700
Takahashi
Sample Input 3
100 100 100 -100
Sample Output 3
40000
